## Religion of Souls

**Recognition of the followers of Deen-e-Ilahi,
‘The Religion of God’**

> Into which all the rivers merge is known as an ocean, and into
which all the religions merge is the Religion of God.

> ‘This is the divine avenue where all four religions intermingle.’
(Sultan Haq Bahu)

### The Elementary Stage of Recognition
When both the heart and the soul are revived with God’s remembrance,
whether it is through performance of worship or through the merciful sight
of the Spiritual Guide, in both cases, it is predestined. The seeker begins
to disapprove of sins and if a sin is committed, he feels blameworthy and
makes efforts to avoid it in the future.

**God says, ‘I like those individuals also who exert themselves to refrain
from sins.’**

Love of the world starts to leave off the heart, and God’s love starts
to prevail. The seeker begins to feel he is getting rid of greed, jealousy,
stinginess and false pride. The tongue quits backbiting. The seeker observes
humility in him. Stinginess is replaced by generosity, and the lies leave off.
Prohibited carnal desires are replaced by lawful ones. The seeker begins to
disapprove of unlawful wealth, prohibited provision and actions.

### The Ultimate Stage of Recognition
One completely quits hashish, opium, heroin, tobacco and alcohol. One
meets highly spiritual dignitaries in dreams, meditation and through
spiritual insight. Nafs Al Ammara (the Commanding Self) turns into
Nafs Mutma’inna (the Divinely Content Self). The Ana enters in a private
audience with God. All the veils between God and the man are lifted. One
shuns the sins. One obtains the ultimate station in God’s love and union
with Him. He turns into a Provider from being a simple man.

Since souls of the elite from different religions would join this Spiritual
League, as they had already affirmed the declaration of faith before God
on the primordial day, and God had witnessed it; therefore, affiliation
with a religion would not be a problem (and anyone from any religion
would be able to join it). All would be allowed to worship according
to their respective religions. However, their hearts would bear the same
name of God. In short, they would be united in hearts regardless of their
religious background. They will become Godly when they will have God
in their hearts. Subsequent to this, God may either confine somebody to
Himself or send anybody as a guide in any religion. There will be different
categories for them: Mufeed (useful to render guidance), Munfarid (good
for himself), Soldiers, Commanders. The supporters and helpers from the
category of sinners also will reach some kind of rank.

Many of those (Muslims or non-Muslims) who failed to join this League of
Mehdi would join the Anti-Christ (Dajjal). In the end, there will be a bloody
war between the forces of Imam Mehdi and the Anti-Christ. Followers of
Jesus Christ, Imam Mehdi and Kalki Avatar will be united and will defeat
the Anti-Christ. The majority of the followers of the Anti-Christ will be
killed, and their survivors will live in fear and helplessness quietly. Imam
Mehdi and Jesus Christ will reign over the hearts of humanity. Peace will
prevail in the entire world. All the religions will perish, and a new religion
will emerge. That will be God’s favourite religion, ‘Ishq-e-Allah’ (God’s
rapturous love)—the gist of all religions established by the Prophets and
their celestial books, acceptable to the entire humankind, superior to all
forms of worship, even greater than God’s love.

**‘Faith is not aware of where the rapturous love of God can take the
seeker to.’ (Sultan Haq Bahu)**

### Iqbal had drawn a picture of these times:

> The world needs the Mehdi whose vision will shake the foundation of
Universal Thoughts. The hidden secrets are to reveal for the era of the
hadith-phrase ‘You cannot see me’ has gone past. Whoever’s personal identity
of the Self becomes known first, is the Awaited Imam Mehdi. Open my eyes
in the mirror of comprehension, and see for yourself the vague picture of
the future.

> Look at the sky, the earth, the space, and the rising Sun from the east.
O’ Giver of the wine, the era when the drinkers would hide and drink is
history now. The entire world will be a tavern one day, and every soul on
earth a drinker.

> The time for unveiling is nigh, seeing the divine splendour will be common.
The secret that silence kept veiled will soon manifest now.
Emerging from the desert, who toppled up the Roman Empire, I heard angels
saying that the lion will be in action again.

None of the celestial books or Saheefah (random inspiration from God)
is God’s Religion. These books direct the followers to adopt Salat, fasting
and growing a beard, whereas God is carefree of such restraints. These
religions were established to enlighten and purify the nations of the
Prophets; whereas, God Himself is the purest form of Light. When a man,
after union with God, becomes Light, then he too enters the Religion of
God. God’s Religion is His love and affection. It is the translation and
definition of His ninety-nine names. God is one who makes mention of
His Friends. God, Himself is Love, Lover and Beloved. Should God grant
a man a portion from the attributes mentioned above, then he too enters
the Religion of God. Then, seeing God is his worship (Salat), and the
remembrance of God is his longing. The seeing of God provides atonement
for his missed obligatory and non-obligatory rituals. Then, not even the 
collective worship of the Jinns, the angels and the entire human race can
reach his spiritual level.

For such a person Abdul Qadir Jilani said, 

> ‘Worship or its intent after one
has acquired union with God is a grave ingratitude to the divine bounty.’

Bulleh Shah said,
> ‘Since we adopted the worship of Ishq, we became
forgetful of mosques and temples.’

Iqbal said,
> ‘A naive clergyman may not be aware of such a delightful divine
bounty.’

With reference to this secretive doctrine did Abu Hurera say, ‘Mohammad
granted to me knowledge of two types, I told you of one of the types, you
would kill me if I told you the other.’

The history bears witness to the fact that whoever revealed this knowledge
was killed as Shah Mansoor and Sarmad were. And today, even Gohar
Shahi, due to His revealing of this knowledge, is threatened with similar
consequences.

The Prophets abide by the Sharia law to become a model for the Ummah
(nation), so that they may imitate and follow. Otherwise, they do not need
to worship. They have the rank of Prophet-hood since primordial time,
long before the existence of the Sharia law. Since they have to perfect the
religion as a model, if the Prophets miss out any of the rituals, or if they
adopt an act, their nation imitates them. Hence they have to remain careful
and sober. Can anyone be justified to say that a Prophet will enter the
hellfire if he does not worship? Not at all! Can anyone be justified to say
that one cannot be a Prophet if he does not worship? Can anyone claim
that one cannot become a Prophet if he does not learn the knowledge?
Why are the Saints made subject to objections? Note that Sainthood is a
substitute to Prophet-hood.

**Remember well:** those that claimed to possess unification and union with
God without seeing God, or perceived themselves to be worthy of this
status and pretended to be as such are heretics and deniers of the truth.
Verily! The Koran curses such liars who deny the truth. Due to them,
thousands of believers lose their faith and happen to waste their valuable
time.

***This book is worthy of research and consideration for all religions,
sects and all humanity, and is a live challenge to those who refute
spirituality.***
