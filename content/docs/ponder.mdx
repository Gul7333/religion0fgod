## Ponder! Progeny of Which of the Many Adams Do You Come From?

According to various celestial books, fourteen thousand different Adams
came in this world. And some said, ‘Adam Safi Allah is the fourteen
thousandth (14000th) and the last Adam as well.’ Verily, there came many
Adams to this world. When Adam Safi Allah was being moulded with
clay, the angels tipped, pointing towards Adam, ‘This too would cause
mischief and strife in the world.’ The angels’ remarks show that they were
already aware of the stories of earlier Adams. Had there not been more
than one Adam, how would they know as to how he would behave once
he is in the world?

The Guarded Tablet contains various languages, various Kalimas, various
Jantar Mantars (magical codes), various God’s names, various scriptural
verses, and even mentions magic acts, which the two angels, Harut and
Marut, taught people. And as punishment, both of the angels are still
hanging upside down in a well, in Babul (Babylon), one of the cities of
Egypt. Each of the Adams was taught a language. Then, the Prophets
were sent in these nations for their guidance. It is, therefore, said that one
hundred and twenty-four thousand Prophets came to the world. It is six
thousand years since Adam Safi Allah came to this world. Had a Prophet
been sent every year to this world, the total number would not have
exceeded six thousand. Some time later, these nations were destroyed due
to their disobedience. Just as archaeological excavations found the ancient
cities later along with the writings in ancient languages, incomprehensible
even today. Some nation was destroyed by a hurricane. And some people
survived in certain areas just like some people survived after the Noah’s
Hurricane. Finally, Adam Safi Allah was risen to an exalted nature above
all others, and was sent in Arabia. All of the Grand Messengers were born
in his progeny. The languages of the various Adams remained in practice
among their surviving nations.

When the last Adam came, they were taught the Suryani language. When
the children of Adam Safi Allah travelled far and wide for tourism, they
came across members of the previous nations also. Some of them who
either liked the place or were inspired by the lavish green fields settled in
those places. Suryani was the language of the land in Arabia. Through
inter-mingling of various nations, Suryani evolved other languages too,
viz, Persian, Latin, Sanskrit, and finally the English language emerged
through the process of lingo-evolution. Progeny of several different Adams
was settled in various islands. One of the Adams was a gypsy; the race of
this particular Adam still lives, and is responsible for discovering various
nations.

The nations that lived in islands across the ocean were unaware of each
other. A long sea-voyage was not possible either by horses or the paddled
boats. Columbus successfully made a motorised ship, through which, he
was the first one to have reached the American soil. He saw red people at
the shore. He thought and he said, ‘Perhaps, I have arrived in India, and
they are Red Indians.’ This is why this nation is called the Red Indians.
They still live in North Dakota. I asked the chief of a Red Indian Tribe,
‘Who is your Adam?’ He replied, ‘According to our religion, our Adam is
in Asia, whose wife is Eve; but according to our history, our Adam came
from a mountain in South Dakota.’ The mountain is still marked as a
historical place.

It’s a general perception among people that the English and the Americans
have a fair complexion owing to cold weather in their regions, but that is
not true. Ancient lineage of dark complexioned Adam still exists in the
same region which could not develop fair complexion until date. Therefore,
this is the reason that the colour, the appearance, the temperament, the
intellect, the languages and the diet of human beings differ. The chain of
the progeny of Adam Safi Allah did not spread beyond the Middle East.
This is why people of the Middle East resemble each other in features. It
is generally believed that Adam Safi Allah descended in Sri Lanka and
subsequently, migrated to the Arab region where he lived all his life. His
grave is in the Arab region. The question is who pointed out the descent of Adam Safi Allah and his foot-proofs in Sri Lanka, which are still preserved?
It establishes the fact that some tribe had pre-existed Adam Safi Allah’s
descent in Sri Lanka.

The Prophet-hood and Sainthood terminated in the nations that were
destroyed. Their survivors, being deprived of these spiritual dignitaries,
went astray some time later. As these lands were gradually discovered, the
Saints from Asia reached these lands and taught the locals their respective
religions. Today, the Asian religions have begun to be widely practised
throughout these regions. Jesus was from Jerusalem, Moses was from
Bethlehem, Mohammad was from Mecca; Noah and Abraham also were
from Arabia.

Some of the generations were tormented and destroyed. Some other
generations, as a punishment, were transformed into bears and apes. Some
of the survivors out of sheer fear inclined towards God and the others
regarded God as a penaliser, therefore, they developed contempt for God.
They dismissed all commandments of God, and perceived that God never
existed, man is an insect, and heaven and hell are but a myth. In Moses’
era the nation that was transformed into apes as a punishment headed
towards Europe. The mothers-to-be from this nation still gave birth to
human babies. This nation still exists. They believe themselves to originate
from apes.

The nation which was transformed into bears headed towards the jungles
of Africa. The mothers-to-be of the time bore human babies, and it further
developed yet into another generation known as Mumm (Bigfoot). They
have long hair all over the body. They are mostly women. They often kidnap
humans. Religions do not interest them. Owing to their appearance as
humans, they tend to cover the private parts of the body with tree leaves.
One of the many Adams, due to his wrong-doings was awarded a thousand
years punishment, and was transformed into a snake. His surviving nation
exists in the guise of a typical snake, called the Ruha. Exactly a thousand
years after birth, they obtain the ability to transfigure as a human being.

## Incidence with Alexnder

Once upon a time, Alexander the Great had been to a jungle for hunting.
As he was passing through, he saw a beautiful woman crying. She, when
asked, said that she was the princess of China. She said that she had come
there with her husband for hunting. A lion ate her husband, and thus
she had been left behind alone. Alexander the Great said to her that he
would have her sent back to China if she went with him. She said that her
husband had died, and she was afraid she wouldn’t be welcome back home.
Alexander the Great took her home, and married her.

A few months later, Alexander the Great complained of a stomach ache.
All sorts of remedies were tried on him, but his health did not improve.
The pain worsened. The doctors were helpless. A snake charmer visited
Alexander the Great to cure him. He told him in private that he could
cure him; however, there were a few conditions. He further said, ‘If I fail
to cure you within a few days, you may get me killed by all means.’ He
advised, ‘Tonight, prepare rice with lentils with an extra bit of salt. You
and your wife should eat plenty of it. Lock the room from inside, so that
neither of you are able to leave the room. Do not sleep, rather pretend to
your wife that you are sleeping and make sure not even a single drop of
water is available in the room.’ Alexander the Great did as he was advised.
Some time during the night, his wife felt thirsty and she noticed the water
pot was empty. She tried to open the door, but it was locked. She looked
at her husband and assumed he was in deep sleep. She transfigured into a
snake and found her way through a hole. She drank water, re-entered the
room in the form of a snake, and then she returned to the human form
again. Alexander the Great saw it all. In the morning, he told the snake
charmer all that he saw the previous night. The snake charmer said, ‘Your
wife is a female snake that transfigures after one thousand years and her
poison caused the pain in your stomach.’ Then, this woman was taken to
the sea, on the pretense that they were going on excursion; the sign where
she was thrown still exists today and is called ‘The Barrier of Alexander’.
This particular species of snakes still exists in the world. Ordinary snakes
do not have ears; however, these snakes that can turn into human beings
have ears.

A tribe of an unknown Adam is secluded within the mountains of China.
Dhul-Qarnain built a stone wall to prevent them from entering this region.
They have very long ears and they use one ear as a bed sheet and the other
as a blanket. They are known as Gog Magog. Science has discovered many
regions but there still remains a lot to be discovered. The Yetis (Abominable
Snowmen) live behind the mountains of the Himalayas. A group of man 
lives in the forests also. Nobody knows their language. They also, worship
according to the principles taught by their Adam. They have a tribal system
for discipline and principles of life. Besides these continents of Earth,
there are many more planets, viz, the Moon, the Sun, Jupiter and Mars,
etc. Adams came there also, however, these planets have already witnessed
doomsday. Some of these were destroyed by cutting off the supply of
oxygen and others were completely wiped out.
