## Introduction to the Person of His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi

His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi was born on 25th November, 1941, in
a small village of the Indian Sub-Continent, ‘Dhok Gohar Shah’, District
of Rawalpindi. The mother of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi is
a descendent of Fatima Al Zahra, meaning Sadat Family (Progeny of
Fatima), from the grandsons of Syed Gohar Ali Shah. The father of His
Divine Eminence is a descendant of one of the (maternal) grandsons
of Syed Gohar Ali Shah, and his grandfather comes from the Mughal
family.

His Divine Eminence developed inclination towards shrines of the Saints
since His childhood. The father of His Divine Eminence says, ‘At the age
of 5-6 years, His Divine Eminence would disappear, and we would find
Him sitting at the shrine of Nizam Uddin Auliya in New Delhi, India.
Occasionally, it seemed to me that His Divine Eminence was talking to
Nizam Uddin Auliya.’ This incident dates back to the time when the father
of His Divine Eminence resided in Delhi for his job.

When His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi visited India in March 1997, the
caretaker of the shrine of the Saint Nizam Uddin, upon the instructions
of the soul of Nizam Uddin Auliya, placed the ‘Turban of Honour’ on
the head of His Divine Eminence. ‘Since childhood, whatever His Divine
Eminence predicted came true. Hence, I would fulfil all His reasonable
wishes.’ The father of His Divine Eminence says, ‘Gohar Shahi, as per His
routine, comes out to the lawn in the house every morning, and I stand
in respect to greet him.’ His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi disapproves of this, and says, ‘I feel shy, as I am your son. So do not stand in respect
for me.’ The father of His Divine Eminence says that he always explains
that he stands in respect for the presence of God that dwells in His Divine
Eminence Gohar Shahi. Amir Hussain, a teacher from Mora Noorie
Primary School recollects, ‘I am famous for being a stern teacher in the
area. I used to penalise the naughty kids. His Divine Eminence would
sometimes reach the school late, and when I would want to punish His
Divine Eminence, I would feel as if somebody had gotten hold of the stick,
and I would end up smiling.’

## Remarks of the family members and friends of His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi:

‘We never saw His Divine Eminence arguing, fighting or beating up
anybody. If any of His friends was angry and wanted to get physical, His
Divine Eminence would simply smile.’

## Remarks by wife of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:

‘Firstly, His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi is hardly ever angry, however,
His Divine Eminence expresses intense reactions against immorality and
indecency. His Divine Eminence is exceptionally generous. In the morning
when His Divine Eminence leaves for the meeting with daily visitors in
the lawn of the house, His pockets are full of money. However, when His
Divine Eminence returns, the pockets are empty. His Divine Eminence
gives away all the money to the needy. When I am in need of money, His
Divine Eminence shows an innocent face, thus I get angry. Looking at His
innocent face, I say a couplet, “Thou art so generous by heart, but parted
with all the wealth. ”’

## Remarks by sons of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:

‘Our father (His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi) is very affectionate
towards us and sees to our needs. But when we ask our father for money,
He gives us but a small sum. Our father says, “You will be spending
extravagantly.” We say to our father, “Either you give us plenty of money
or turn us into a fakir.”’

## Remarks by the mother of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi: 

‘During His childhood, when He would not go to school for a day or two,
or if He suffered a business loss later in life, I would criticise Him, but He
would never raise His head in response. My Spiritual Guide, Kakka Miyan
from the village of Shams, would advise me, “Do not swear at Riaz. You
do not know what I see in Him.” He has so much sympathy for humanity
that when He would find out that a passenger bus had broken down even
at a distance of 10 miles, He would get food prepared for the passengers
and would take it to them riding His bicycle.’

## Remarks by Mohammad Iqbal of Fazooliyan, a close friend of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:

Mohammad Iqbal says, ‘In the rainy season, as we would walk through
the fields, we would walk on the trail, and countless ants also would be
crawling there. We did not care about them, but His Divine Eminence
Ra Gohar Shahi would always avoid walking on the trail, lest the ants
are harmed or run over. His Divine Eminence would prefer to wade in
the mud instead. When a false case of murder was instigated against His
Divine Eminence, Qaddous Shiekh of the crime branch (of the police
department) came for inquiry. The residents of the area told him, “We
don’t think His Divine Eminence would have ever killed a mosquito, let
alone a human being!”’

## Remarks on the aunt of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:

I was then a student of the eighth grade. One day, my aunt who was very
religious and a committed worshipper but possessed greed and jealousy
also (exoteric worshippers normally possess such vices), told me everything
else was fine in me for except that I did not observe ritual prayers (Salat).
I said to my aunt that Salat was a gift of God, and that I did not want to
send forth bukhl, takabbur, hassad, and keena (grudge) mixed with the
prayer. I would observe Salat whenever I could do it correctly. Unlike her,
who observed the prayer and at the same time, was involved in great sins
like backbiting and slandering.

## His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi recollects His childhood stories:

Since the age of 10-12 I began to speak with God in dreams. I used to see
Bait al Mamour; however, I was unaware of its reality. After I had gone
through the austerities, all those scenes and conversation with God were
repeated, and thus the reality was unfolded. Once my uncle, who was in
the national army and who would often visit the brothel, took me with
him to escape the doubts of the family, because they would not allow
him. He would give me tea and biscuits, and would go inside the brothel.
I was unaware of brothels and prostitutes. My uncle would tell me that
these brothels are the offices for women. After some time, I began to feel
disgusted with the place. My uncle said, ‘God has created women for this
purpose only.’ In other words, my uncle tried to incite me to do the same.
My uncle’s words disturbed me. I could not sleep all night struggling with
my Nafs, and then suddenly I fell asleep.

I saw a large round elevated platform, and I was standing below. I heard
a loud voice from above it, ‘Bring him forth.’ I noticed that two men
held my uncle, and brought him forward; they pointed towards him,
indicating that he was the one. The voice was heard again, ‘Beat him with
the metal bars.’ The men started beating him. He then screamed, roared,
and eventually his face turned into that of a swine. The voice was heard
again, ‘If you do the same, you will suffer the same.’ I then repented, sought
forgiveness, after which I woke up with these words on my tongue, ‘My
Lord I repent, my Lord I repent.’ The effects of this dream stayed with me
for a few years.

The next day, I was travelling towards my village on a bus; I noticed that a
few robbers were trying to pull out a cassette player from a taxi. When the
driver resisted, they killed him with knives. Our bus stopped at the scene.
The robbers escaped when they saw us. The driver died in agony before
our eyes. The truth that life is so uncertain crossed my mind. At night as I
was about to sleep, the following verse began echoing in my mind. ‘Forgive
all my errors, I have come and fallen at your Holy Court.’ I cried all night
long. Sometime after this event, I renounced the world, and went to the
tomb of the Saint Jaam Dataar. But I didn’t find my destiny there either.
My brother-in-law brought me back to the world.

At the age of 34, Bari Imam appeared before me. He said, ‘Your time has
come to return to the jungle.’ After three years of seclusion and retreat,
when I had obtained some spiritual experience, I went to the tomb of Jaam
Dataar. He appeared before me. I said, ‘If I had been accepted earlier,
I would have avoided a carnal lifestyle.’ He replied, ‘The time was not
appropriate then.
