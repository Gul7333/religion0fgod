## Utterances of His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi
There are three parts of exoteric knowledge and one part of esoteric
knowledge.

One has to find a Moses to obtain exoteric knowledge and a Khidr to
obtain esoteric knowledge from.

The inspirational voice that one hears without the presence of Gabriel
is known as Ilhaam. The knowledge that one obtains without Gabriel
accompanying it, is known as Sahifa (Divine Scroll) and Hadith Qudsee
(conversation with God without a medium). The knowledge conveyed
through the Gabriel is known as the Koran, whether it contains exoteric
knowledge or esoteric knowledge, whether you call it the Torah, the Psalms
of David or the Bible.

The religious scholars get away with their faults and errors by labelling it
as politics. Faults and errors by the Saints are regarded and ignored as acts
of wisdom. Faults and errors by the Prophets are not regarded as faults
and errors.

The concerned souls inside the human body gain strength with whatever
type of spiritual practice they are engaged in. And those that are not
engaged in any spiritual practice are dormant and senseless. And those that,
through any means, have absorbed God’s name in their souls, their hobby
is then constant remembrance of God (Dhikr Sultani) and Rapturous Love
of God (Ishq-e-Allah).

No wonder Iqbal said, ‘If you possess Rapturous Love of God, your kufr
(ingratitude) is Islam (submission to God).’

Sachal Sain said, ‘Denial or submission to God becomes insignificant and
nullified when one does not love God.’

Sultan Haq Bahu said, ‘The stage of belief is unaware of the station of
God’s Rapturous Love.’

God’s mercy falls upon the land where such individuals visit or stay, and
the religions they belong to or join also come under God’s shower of mercy.
Baba Farid and Baba Guru Nanak are from among such Saints. Then, the
Hindus and the Sikhs do not hesitate to pay homage to Baba Farid, and
the Muslims and the Christians do not hesitate to pay homage to Baba
Guru Nanak.

> ***Imam Mehdi will rejuvenate all the
religions!***

Mujaddid (the revivers) emerged within Muslim Ummah in the post-
Mohammadan era, and they revived the religion. The amendment of
these Mujaddid will become ineffective after the advent of Imam Mehdi.
And Imam Mehdi will rejuvenate all religions in his very own way. It is
mentioned in several books that Imam Mehdi shall found a brand new
religion.

## Utterances of His Divine Eminence R a Gohar Shahi

If an individual worships all his life, but in the end, he happens to oppose
Imam Mehdi and Jesus Christ (return of both the Personalities to this
world is imminent; Jesus Christ appears with the same body as he was
raised up with, and Imam Mehdi in the body with the terrestrial spirits of
Prophet Mohammad), such an individual is hell-bound in the similitude
of Balyim Ba’our, and he is as rejected by God as Iblis (the Devil) was. On
the contrary, if an individual lives all his life like a dog, but in the end,
he happens to support and love Imam Mehdi and Jesus Christ, such an
individual shall enter paradise in the similitude of Qatmir.

Some of the religions and sects say, ‘Jesus had died, and his tomb is
situated in Afghanistan.’ This is a misleading propaganda. The tomb in
Afghanistan is not that of Jesus Christ, but of a Saint whose name also is
Isa. In that primitive age, what could have been the purpose of burial at
such a far off place? They argue, ‘How was Jesus raised to the skies?’ We
say, ‘How was Adam descended on earth?’ Remember: Idrees (Enoch) still
lives physically in paradise. Khidr (A mystical figure) and Ilyas (Elias) are
present on earth, and they haven’t tasted death yet.

Hayat Al Amir, the grandson of Abdul Qadir Jilani, also has been living
for 600 years. Abdul Qadir Jilani instructed him, ‘Do not die until you
convey my salutation to Imam Mehdi.’ It is Hayat Al Amir who gave Shah
Latif the title of Bari Imam. The site of his sitting place is still preserved in
Bara Koh which is situated near Murree, Pakistan.

Punishment for exoteric sins is imprisonment, fine or the death penalty.
Blameworthiness is the punishment for the ones on the spiritual path.
However, the punishment for the esoteric sins is severe. For those who
backbite, a certain amount of virtues are transferred as a fine from their
account to those affected. Greed, jealousy, stinginess and false pride
efface their hard-earned virtues. Such individuals, if they possess a certain
amount of God’s Light, lose it when they blaspheme and hold grudges
against Prophets and Saints, just as Sheikh Sanan’s marvels and spiritual
insight were confiscated due to blasphemy against Abdul Qadir Jilani.

Bayazid Bastami learnt that a man spoke ill of him. Bayazid started to pay
him for this. The man accepted the money, yet he continued to speak ill
of him. One day, his wife said to him, ‘Either you should stop accepting
the money, or you should stop speaking ill of Bayazid Bastami.’ He started
praising Bayazid Bastami. When Bayazid Bastami found out that he then
praised him, he stopped his financial support. He visited Bayazid and
said, ‘You paid me when I spoke badly about you, why did you stop my
financial support now when I praise you?’ Bayazid said, ‘Then you were
my servant, you spoke ill of me and it would burn my sins. You stopped
doing it, why should I pay you now?’ The vices mentioned here relate
to Nafs Al Ammara, and Iblis (the Devil) is its helper. Piety, generosity,
forgiveness, patience and gratitude, humility and theophanies belong to
Qalb-e-Shaheed. And the Wali-Murshid (Spiritual Master) is its guardian
and helper (he helps the disciple against evil plots).

In the presence of Nafs Al Ammara, Light of Divine Words do not stay in
the heart, even if one memorises the verses of the celestial book. Similitude
of such an individual is that of a parrot. When Nafs turns to the Contented
Self, then no impurity can stay in you. Then, your cockerel of lust becomes
pure. For purification of Nafs, find a Divinely Appointed Nafs-Shikan (the
Self Demolisher), and such sages are appointed by God at all times.

The exterior of the body is cleansed with water while the interior is purified
with God’s Light (Noor). Without cleanliness, it is unclean and impure for
only the clean body deserves the worthiness of worship. And worthiness of
divine theophanies is for the clean heart only. And this is when the celestial
books render guidance to the pure ones. Otherwise, the people of the books
become enemies to each other. Mujaddid Alif Thani states in his book,
‘Individuals with Nafs Al Ammara are not worthy of studying the Koran.’
The beginners in spirituality must initially strive to purify themselves by means of Dhikr Allah (God’s remembrance). And the seekers who are in
the final stages in spirituality are advised to study the Koran.

> **Mohammad said, ‘The Koran curses on some of its readers.’**

> **Bulleh Shah said, ‘Such people enjoy the divine favours and deny it,
yet to show off, they carry the Koran under their armpit.’**

A worshipper perceives that he is near to God because he is awake all night
worshipping God. But after worship, your prayers are for health, long
life, wealth, and for the damsels and slaves of the Paradise. Ponder! Did
you ever pray to God, ‘O’ God, I desire from Thee nothing but Thee’? A
religious scholar perceives that he is near to God hence he thinks he has
already obtained salvation. He thinks, ‘I have knowledge of the Koran in
me.’ The question is why then do you declare others as hell-bound though
every Muslim possesses some amount of knowledge and has memorised
some of the verses of the Koran? Ponder! Who sells the divine knowledge?
And who sells himself? Who backbites against the Saints? Who possesses
jealousy, false pride and greed? Whose custom is it to bear one thing
in the heart and something else on the tongue? Who says one thing in
the morning, and denies it in the evening? Who presents the truth as
falsehood, and falsehood as the truth? If you are far from these traits,
then you are a Khalifa-e-Rasul (Deputy of the Prophet), and showing the
back to you is a great disrespect. Meaning, an orator in appearance while
the Koran in reality.

If you are afflicted with such diabolical traits, perhaps you are from among
the clerics of the fourteenth century for whom the wolf said, ‘May I be
counted as those who ate the Prophet Joseph.’
