## Third Category of the Soul

Those that desired neither the world nor the paradise and gazed at God’s
face only, sought God in this world and sacrificed all in search for God.
Many kings also abandoned their kingdoms, made the jungle their abode,
and put up with hunger and thirst. Some of the aspirants spent many
years sitting in the rivers. After successful spiritual discipline, they became
known as God’s Friends. God deputised them on different saintly posts
and divine assignments. And they became a divine remedy and a means
of hope for the hell-bound souls.

> Just as the famous poet, Iqbal, mentions in one of his poems, ‘A glance
of a Godly man changes the fate.’

One must have physically seen the Spiritual Guide upon each birth of
the terrestrial spirits. A relation with the Guru of the previous birth or a
relation with the ancestral Guru becomes nullified with the present body,
just as the Prophet-hood becomes invalid after the arrival of the Grand
Messenger. Just as Moses (Musa Kalim Allah) was one of the Grand
Messengers, and all the Prophets that came after Moses, their religions
were abrogated on arrival of Jesus, Spirit of God (Isa Rouh Allah). And the
Prophets that came (outside Arabia) in the duration between the time of
Jesus (Spirit of God) and Mohammad, all of them were abrogated on the
arrival of Mohammad. The religions founded by the Grand Messengers
have been valid until date. These Grand Messengers are Adam Safi Allah,
Ibrahim Khalil Allah (Abraham), Musa Kalim Allah (Moses), Isa Rouh
Allah (Jesus), and Mohammad Rasul Allah (Mohammad). And every
Saint follows in the spiritual footsteps of the Grand Prophets (meaning
receives the divine grace from their respective subtlety of the breast).
Because all five subtleties of the human breast are related to the five Grand
Messengers, on account of this, spiritual benevolence and Prophet-hood
thereof remains valid until the Day of Judgement.

There is a general belief that one must recite the declaration of faith in
order to enter the paradise. Please be warned that it does not refer to the
declaration of faith belonging to a single Prophet in particular. And it
alludes to the declaration of faith and religions belonging to all Grand
Messengers. Remember well: Mohammad said, ‘I have come to reform
in what has been altered and not to deny any religion or celestial book of
any Grand Messenger.’ The spiritual doctrine and religion of Adam Safi
Allah continues even today. Those that possess Dhikr Qalb, that weep and
observe humility in God’s name, that repent over their sins, and who seek
to avoid sins fall under the category of the first religion. And this was the
primary Prophet-hood and the primary form of worship.

Every Ghous (leader of a chain of Saints) and every Saint is on the footsteps
(the particular spiritual path) of a particular Prophet. For example, the
category mentioned above is on the footsteps of Adam Safi Allah.

> Mujaddid Alif Thani said, ‘I am on the footsteps of Moses.’ The chain
of Qalandars emerges from Jesus Christ. Abdul Qadir Jilani comes from
Mashrab-e-Mohammad (the spiritual path of Mohammad).
