## Who Deserves the Paradise?

Some predestined hell-bound people endeavour to earn the paradise by
way of good deeds and worship. But, in the end, they are rejected by God
as the Satan was, because they inherit bukhl (stinginess), takabbur (false
pride), and hassad (jealousy).

A Prophetic Tradition states, ‘One who has even a tiniest amount of bukhl,
hassad and takabbur shall not enter the paradise.’

Predestined paradise-bound individuals are easily recognisable even if
they do not perform any worship. Such people are kind, pure, free of
jealousy, covetousness, and they are generous. Should they engage in
worship also, such people may attain a higher level of faith. God creates
divine concessions for such people for their salvation. Some people stay
suspended in between and do have a continuing record of their good and
bad deeds.

And there are some elite of the elite individuals, and they did love God in
the primordial time. They are carefree of the hell or the heaven; rather, they
sacrifice all emotional, mental and physical belongings and attachments
for the sake of God’s love. They manage to enlighten their souls with the
divine mercy and God’s remembrance. Moreover, they manage to see God.
For such people alone, is reserved the paradise of Firdaus.

For category as such, the Prophet declares, ‘Some people would enter the
paradise without accountability.’

## Explanation
Luxuries of the world were written in the book of fate for those who were
shown the modelled luxuries of the world. Such souls put even their life
on stake to gain worldly pleasures. They committed crimes as horrible
as robbery, bribery, usury, and rejected even God’s unity (Wahdaniyat).
Some of the souls from the above-mentioned category adopted religions,
and performed worship to gain paradise; however, their attempts were
wasted like that of the Azazeel (the Devil). Because the religion or faith
they adopted was either blasphemous to God, or it was disapproved by
God, hence, it hurdled in their way.

The second category of souls, who opted for the paradise, laid foremost
priority on worship and austerities along with mundane chores. Greed of
damsels and palaces in the paradise made them run to the worship places,
thus they thrived in obtaining paradise. For those who, from this category,
became lazy in regards to performance of worship, a divine concession
earned them a place in the paradise as they were already paradise-bound in
fate. However, they could not achieve the ranks equal to those of the pious
ones in the paradise. For such people, God says, ‘Do they perceive that
we would equal them to the pious ones?’ (As there are seven grades of the
paradise). The sources of guidance for the common folks are the Prophets,
the books, the Gurus and the Saints. They must enter a religion and affirm
a declaration of faith (Kalima). The elite come under the Graceful Sight
of God without a religion or a book. In other words, the Light guides
them.

## It is stated in the Scripture, ‘God guides through the Divine Light whosoever he wishes to.’

It is said that the declaration of faith is an obligation for entry into the
paradise. Remember the fact that the souls are to enter the paradise, not
these bodies, and the Kalima is to be declared at the time of entry into the
paradise. Therefore, the souls will declare the Kalima in Maqam-e-Deed
(the Station of Beholding) at any time; or they might as well do it after
death, just as the souls of Prophet Mohammad’s father, mother and uncle
were granted to affirm it after their physical demise. Bear in mind that the
elite of the elite souls had already affirmed the declaration of faith, had
taken the necessary vows, and had obtained the verification before their
descent in this world.

The Prophet Mohammad said, ‘I had already been a Prophet prior to my
arrival in this world.’ This is the utterance of the soul for the souls, as the
body was given in this world only. The leaders exist only if there are nations
to lead; similarly, the Prophets exist if there are followers to follow. In the
absence of followers, Prophets are not required!

Then such people (the Saints) are sent into different religions, some in the
guise of Baba Farid and some others in the guise of Guru Nanak. The
souls in search of God do not mind the religion, and despite different
religions, they seek guidance from whomsoever they believe is connected
with God. Ghous Ali Shah, a Saint, wrote in his book, Tazkira Ghousia, ‘I
obtained spiritual grace from Hindu sages also.’ The Muslim clerics could
not understand the concealed secret behind it, so they issued fatwas of
the death penalty for Ghous Ali Shah. They threatened the Muslims that
their houses would be set on fire if that particular book was found in their
possession. Interestingly enough, the book is still available in both India
and Pakistan, and it is very popular.

Some nations accepted the Prophets, and some others rejected them. To the
nations rejecting them, God, nevertheless, sent down the guides according
to their religion. They taught their nations to save them from sins. The
guides endeavoured to turn the direction of the followers towards the Lord,
through their own method of worship, rituals, and customs. They taught
them to love God, and establish peace. If such individuals were not around,
all religions would have become thirsty of each other’s blood today. Such
souls receive guidelines from Vishnu Maharaj (Khidr) also, who knows
the secrets of all religions.
