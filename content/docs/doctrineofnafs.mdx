## The Doctrine of Nafs (the Self)

It is a Satanic cell and navel point is its abode. All the Prophets and Saints
sought refuge from its mischief. Its diet is phosphorus and bad odour,
which is also found in bones, coal and cow dung. All religions insist on a
proper bath after copulation because unpleasant odour releases through
skin pores during sexual activity. Malodorous drinks and animal meat also
are prohibited for consumption.

On the day of Azal (Primordial), all souls in front of God up to the mineral
souls, became acquainted with each other and united. The man, inspired
by the mineral soul in him, built homes from stones. And he made roofs
of homes with the wood of trees, inspired by the botanical soul in him.
He benefited himself from the cool shadows of the trees also. The trees
provided him with pure oxygen. Bio-spirits from the rear row that became
animals in this world were declared lawful for consumption by the man. In
addition to these the birds from the same category also were made lawful
for consumption.

On the left side, were created Jinns and infernal spirits, followed by evil
spirits, which, in the end, became God’s enemies. And the animal, botanical
and mineral spirits that appeared from behind evil spirits developed enmity
against human beings. Mineral spirits from this category caused the ashes
of Earth to turn into coal, the gas from which was harmful for human
beings. The botanical spirits from this category brought into existence
dangerous, thorny and man-eating trees. With the animal spirits from
this category, man-eating animals and beasts were created. And the birds
from the same category, owing to their attribute of enmity against human
beings, were declared as unlawful. These birds can be recognised by their
trait of eating food with their claws. The souls at God’s right were appointed
as servants to human beings, message-carriers and helpers. The man was
elevated in eminence above all, and was appointed as God’s vicegerent.
Now it depends on the man, his willingness, efforts and fate whether he
accepts the vicegerency or he rejects it.

In dreams, the Nafs leaves the body, and joins evil gatherings of the Jinns,
in the person’s guise. Nafs is accompanied by the Khannas. It resembles an
elephant. It sits in between the Nafs and the Qalb (the heart). It assists the
Nafs to misguide the man. In addition to this, yet another four birds also
get clung to the four souls of the breast, to misguide the man. For example,
the cockerel is clung to the heart (Qalb), which causes lust to prevail in the
heart. With Dhikr Qalb (invocation of the heart) the cockerel is cleansed
of lust, hence, it begins to differentiate between prohibitions (haram) and
permissible (halal). This is known as a Secured Heart (Qalb-e-Saleem).

The crow is clung to Sirri, and Sirri is afflicted by greed. The peacock is
clung to Khafi, and Khafi is afflicted by jealousy. The pigeon is clung to
Akhfah, and Akhfah is afflicted by stinginess. The traits of these birds
compel the souls of the breast to adopt greed and jealousy, until the
souls are enlightened. These four birds were taken out from Abraham’s
body, purified and placed back in his body. After the demise of purified
individuals, these birds begin to dwell on trees. Individuals who spend
certain amount of time in jungles for austerity learn to imitate the voice
of these birds; as a result of which these birds become familiar with them,
and they help them with healing minor diseases.

## An Important Anecdote:

Nafs belongs to the Satan.

All the five souls of the human breast are related to the five Grand Prophets
respectively. Ana belongs to God.

Similarly, the body is related to the Perfect Spiritual Guide.

Whichever soul is not connected with the concerned, is deprived of its
spiritual grace.

### 1. The Subtlety of Qalb

*The Prophet-hood and the knowledge concerning Qalb was granted to Adam
Safi Allah*

The fleshy heart is known as ‘Dil’ in Urdu, and ‘Fawwad’ in Arabic. The
spiritual faculty clung to the physical heart is known as Qalb. The Prophet-
hood and knowledge pertaining to the faculty of Qalb was granted to
Adam. According to a Prophetic Tradition, ‘The heart is different from the
faculty of Qalb.’ This phenomenal world is known as Nasut (the Terrestrial
Realm). Besides this, there are other realms also such as Malakut (the
Realm of Angels), Ankabut (the Realm of God’s Throne), Jabrut (the
Realm of Souls, ‘Station of Gabriel’), Lahut (the Realm of Nothingness),
Wahdat (the Realm of Divine Unity) and Ahdiyat (the Realm of Divine
Oneness).

These realms and the creatures thereof pre-existed the explosion of the
spheroid of fire in the Terrestrial Realm of Nasut. The angels and the souls
were created simultaneously, however, the archangels and the subtleties of
the breast (Lata’if) already existed in these realms. Subsequently, creatures
inhabited many planets in the Realm of Nasut. Some of the planets have
been annihilated, and the rest await their end. The archangels and the
subtleties of the breast were created seventy thousand years prior to the
Command, ‘Be’ of the souls. Qalb was kept within the Place of Love, and
through Qalb man is supposed to be connected with God. Similitude
of Qalb is like that of the telephone operator between man and God.
Man receives the divine reason and revelation through Qalb.**Footnote: a
Dalil (the divine argument/reason) is always accompanied by Ilhaam
(inspiration). Ilhaam is not authentic if it is not accompanied by a
Dalil.**

The worship of all the subtleties of the breast (Lata’if) reaches the
empyrean of God (Arsh-e-Bala) through Qalb. However, Qalb does not
have access beyond the Realm of Malakut. Its destination is Khuld. Its
mode of worship, and its method of saying the rosary both lie within the
human anatomy. Those that earned paradise but were unaware of this
inner worship would regret it in the paradise, because God says, ‘Do they
perceive that God would equal them with the pious ones?’ Because those 
with the enlightened Qalb would continue to remember in the paradise.
**Footnote: Khuld is the lowest grade of the paradise.**

Worship of the body ends after demise. The unenlightened subtleties of the
breast including the Qalb would either stay weak or decay in the graves.
The enlightened and powerful ones would enter the place of Il’liyeen.
Subsequent to the Day of Judgement, new bodies will be given to all;
these subtleties along with the human soul will be placed in the bodies
of Immortal Saints (who saw God in the phenomenal world). Those who
managed to revive their subtleties and remembered God in this world,
would remember God in the hereafter also; consequently, their level and
ranks would be constantly promoted. Those whose hearts were blind here,
they would remain blind in the hereafter also. This phenomenal world is
the place of practice for deeds and actions. So, they would become stagnant
in terms of performance of good deeds. The Christians, the Jews and the
Hindus also are aware of the subtleties. The Hindu term for the subtleties
is ‘Shaktiyaan-Indaryaan’, and the Muslim term for them is ‘Lata’if’.

Qalb is located on the left of the heart two inches away, and its colour is
yellow. Consequent to its revival, man begins to observe and feel yellowish
light in the eyes. Some spiritual mentors also heal people with colours.
Most people regard the counselling of their heart to be truthful.

The Qalb of a common man is senseless (Snobar). Its counselling may
be influenced by its naivety, the Whisperer (Khannas) or the Self (Nafs),
therefore, it may err in judgement. Reliance on a Qalb-e-Snobar (Senseless
Heart) is folly. When the heart is revived with God’s remembrance, it
begins to differentiate between good and bad, and gains sensibility. This
is known as Qalb-e-Saleem (the Secured Heart). Due to the abundance of
God’s remembrance, it is turned and directed towards God. This is known
as Qalb-e-Muneeb (the Heart Turned to God). It is able to prevent the man
from the committance of vice, however, it still lacks the power of correct
decision. It turns to Qalb-e-Shaheed (the Witnessing Heart) when God’s
Light begins to fall upon it. A Prophetic Tradition relates, ‘Divine Merciful
Sight descends upon broken hearts and broken graves.’ At this moment,
undoubtedly, submit to whatever comes from the heart, as theophanies
turn Nafs also into Mutma’inna (the Divinely Content Self). God is then
closer to him than his jugular vein. At this stage, God then declares, ‘I become his tongue, with which he speaks, and I become his hands with
which he holds.’

### 2. The Human Soul

> *The Prophet-hood and the knowledge concerning the soul was granted to
Abraham*

The human soul is near to the right side of the breast. It is awakened by
loud chanting and visualisation of God’s name upon it, consequently, a
throb like movement becomes prominent at it also. The name ‘Ya-Allah’ is
synchronised with this subtlety. Now two subtleties are engaged in God’s
remembrance; such a person’s spiritual status is greater than that of those
who only revive their heart. The soul is dark red in colour, revival of which
renders access to the Realm of Jabrut. Wrath and anger are attached to it,
which transform into majesty by the divine heat.

### 3. The Subtlety of Sirri (Secret)
> The Prophet-hood and the knowledge concerning Sirri was granted to Moses

This is located between the left side of the breast and the centre of the chest.
It is revived by loud chanting and visualisation of the name ‘Ya Hayyu, Ya
Qayyum’. Its colour is white. It reaches Lahut (the Realm of Nothingness),
through dreams and spiritual journey. With the addition of this subtlety,
now three of them are engaged in God’s remembrance and the rank of
such a person is further increased.

### 4. The Subtlety of Khafi (Arcane)
> _Its Prophet-hood and knowledge was granted to Jesus Christ_

This subtlety is towards the right of the breast from the centre of the chest.
It is revived by loud chanting of the name ‘Ya Wahid’. It is green in colour.
It reaches Wahdat (the Realm of Divine Unity). Now four of them are
engaged in God’s remembrance and the rank of such a person is further
increased.

### 5. The Subtlety of Akhfah (Obscure)
> _Its Prophet-hood and knowledge was granted to Mohammad_

This subtlety is in the centre of the chest. It is revived by loud chanting
of the name ‘Ya Ahad.’ It is violet in colour. It also is related to the veil in
the Realm of Wahdat (the Realm of Divine Unity), behind which is the
throne of God.

The knowledge of the five subtleties of the breast was granted to the
five Grand Messengers categorically. Half a portion of the knowledge of
each subtlety was transferred to the Saints from these Grand Messengers.
There were thus ten parts of the esoteric knowledge, and the Saints then
transmitted this knowledge to the elite. The knowledge of the exterior, the
physical body, and utterance of the tongue all relate to the Realm of Nasut
and the Nafs. This is for common folks. Its knowledge is stored in scripture
which has thirty chapters. The esoteric knowledge also was granted to
the Prophets through revelation (Wahee). Hence, it is also known as ‘The
Esoteric Scripture’. Sometimes the esoteric knowledge would slip out of
Mohammad’s tongue in public that which was confined to the elite only,
therefore, some of the verses of the Koran would later be abrogated. This
inner knowledge was practised and carried on from one heart to another
in the chain of Saints. Now, this knowledge has been made accessible to
the common folks also, through books.

### 6. The Subtlety of Ana
It is located in the head, and is colourless. Dhikr (Remembrance) of ‘Ya
Hu’ is its culmination. It, having gained spiritual strength, reaches and
sees God unveiled, and manages to speak with God. This is the station of
Divine Lovers. Besides this, some of God’s Favourites are also conferred
on them other special divine spirits such as Tifle-e-Noori (Spirit of God’s
Light) and Jussa-e-Tawfeeq-e-Ilahi (Spirit of God). Understanding such
elites is beyond the power of intellect.

Through the subtlety of Ana, God can be seen in dreams. Through
the Jussa-e-Tawfeeq-e-Illahi (Divine Sub-spirit), God can be seen in
Transcendental Meditation (Muraqibah). And those that possess Tifl-e-Noori (God’s image gifted to the elite of the elite, which are only seven
in total, and they are known as Sultan al Fuqra) see God in the state of
consciousness.

The world knows them as ‘The Might of God’. They may, on their accord,
convey anyone to the Maqam Mehmood (the Station of Praise and Glory)
either through worship, austerities, or through their merciful glance.
Believer or disbeliever, dead or alive, matters not in their eyes. Just as a
thief became a Saint with a single merciful glance of Abdul Qadir Jilani.
Abu Bakar Hawari and Mangha Daku also became Saints following a
glance from such elites.

All five of the Grand Messengers were, categorically, given knowledge
pertaining to the subtlety they belong to, hence, spirituality continued
to grow in strength and quality. Whichever subtlety you will revive
and engage with God’s remembrance, you will deserve to obtain grace
of the concerned Grand Messenger, and will be connected with him.
Whichever subtlety comes under the theophanies of God, you will be
granted Sainthood concerning that particular subtlety. Access to the seven
realms and acquisition of different grades in the seven paradises are also
through the subtleties of the breast.

## Functions of Subtleties in the Human Body

### Subtlety of Akhfah (the Obscure):
 It enables the man to speak; without
it, the man is mute (lacking the faculty of speech by birth) even with a
sound tongue. The difference between man and animal is on account of
these subtleties. If the subtlety of Akhfah does not enter the body at the
time of birth for any reason, bringing it in the body was the duty of the
concerned Messenger. Then, the mute would begin to speak.

### Subtlety of Sirri (the Secret):
 It enables man to see. In case this subtlety
is absent in man at the time of birth, he is confirmed blind. Bringing it
into the body was the duty of the concerned Grand Messenger. The sight,
then, is restored to the blind men also.

### The Subtlety of Qalb (the Heart):
 If this is absent in the body, similitude
of the man is like that of an animal; unacquainted with God, and distant
from Him. He lacks sentiments and hunger for God. The task of bringing
it back into the body was assigned to the concerned Grand Messengers
only. Later, the wonders and miracles of the Prophets in form of saintly
marvels were granted to the Saints also. As the missing subtlety is returned
to the body through a Prophet or a Saint, even the deaf, the mute and
blind are healed.

### The Subtlety of Ana:
 The man is mentally impaired due to its absence in
the body, even if the nerves of the brain seem to function normally.

### The Subtlety of Khafi (the Arcane):
 Its absence in the body leaves the
man deaf, even if all the ear holes are opened wide. Physical flaw also shows
a similar syndrome; in which case, it is curable. However, medical help does not serve the purpose in case the concerned subtleties are absent in
the body, unless a Prophet or a Saint extends his help.

### The Subtlety of Nafs (the Self): 
Through Nafs the human heart is inclined
towards the world and its contents; whereas the subtlety of Qalb steers the
man towards God.
