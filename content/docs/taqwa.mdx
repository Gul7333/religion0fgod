## Which Individuals Qualify for Taqwa (Piety)?

### Ilm-ul-Yaqeen (Belief Based upon Knowledge)
Such people are worldly. They are at Maqam-e-Shuneed (belief based on
hearsay). They have belief, based on knowledge. Their faith is based on
hearsay and they have a tendency of going astray. They obtain livelihood,
not through piety, but by making efforts; may it be earned by way of halal
(permissible) or haram (prohibited).
### Ain-al-Yaqeen (The Eye of Certainty)
Individuals from this category are known as Tarak al Dunya (those that
live in the world among people, however, they abstain themselves from the
luxuries of the world). Their heart and inclination is towards God. They are
often shown divine visions. Their station is that of the seeing God. They
earn by permissible means, and anything prohibited hurts them.
### Haq-ul-Yaqeen (Belief Based upon Truth)
Their station is that of Raseed (Intercession to God); God grants them a
rank, and they come under the theophanies of God, and become indifferent
to the world. They live among people in the world, yet refrain from both
permissible and prohibited enterprises. God provides for them from the
unseen resources even if they adopt a solitary lifestyle in the jungles. This
is the station of Taqwa (Piety). Although the beginners in spirituality do
claim to possess Taqwa, they do not successfully maintain it.

## Taqdir (the Fate)
There are two types of Fate:
### 1: Azal (Already Decided Fate)
### 2: Mu’allaq (Indecisive Fate)

Some people inquire, ‘Why need we make an effort for the sustenance when
it is already written in the fate?’ Makhdoum Jahaniya replied, ‘Making
efforts for obtaining the sustenance is also written in the fate.’
For example: A flower vase has been placed for you on the roof (this
is Taqdir-e-Azal). In order to get the flower vase, you have to climb up
through the stairs on to the roof (this is Mu’allaq), which is your choice.
It is for this conditional part that there will be reckoning on the Day of
Judgement, and not in relation to what was destined in Azal. When you
would climb on to the roof, you would collect what was written down for
you and would obtain your fate. If you were lazy, and did not get up to
the roof, then you would be deprived of it. On the other hand, if someone
else, in whose fate there is no flower vase, manages to get on to the roof by
the stairs or by some considerable effort, then he would still be deprived
of it.
