## Introduction by Ra Gohar Shahi

- The religions established through celestial scriptures are correct,
provided they have not been adulterated.
- The religions are like sailboats, and the scholars are like sailors.
Reaching the destination is difficult if either one is defective.
However, the Saints do take even the damaged ‘sailboats’ safely to
the shore. People with religious incapacity flock around the Saints
for this reason.
- God’s love supersedes all the religions and it is core of all the
religions, whereas God’s Light is the guiding lantern onto the
Path.
- There are three parts of exoteric knowledge and one part of
esoteric knowledge, and Khidr (Vishnu Maharaj) dispensed this
knowledge. God’s love is the means of obtaining God’s nearness.
Dogs are better than the hearts empty of God’s love because the
dogs love their master, and this love earned them the nearness of
their master. Otherwise an ‘unclean’ dog and a divinely ordained
human cannot be compared.
- If you desire the paradise and its damsels, then worship extensively
so as to reach the highest level of the paradise.
- If you are in search for God, learn spirituality too so that, through
the Prescribed Divine Path, you may obtain union with God.
