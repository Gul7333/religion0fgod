## Exhaustive explanation about the images on the Sun and the Moon

His Divine Eminence’s fame reached all four corners of the globe on account
of His spiritual sciences, and widespread lectures across the nations.

In the year 1994, in Manchester, some individuals pointed out the image
of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi on the Moon. Similar eye witness
accounts were reported from Pakistan and various other countries also.
Live images of the Moon were recorded by video camera. Images of the
Moon were obtained from NASA and foreign countries. The images were
dull in the beginning, however, within two years, the images became so
vivid and clear that binoculars and computers were not needed to spot
them.

In 1996 our correspondent Zafar Hussain pointed out the existence of these
images to NASA. They replied, ‘We are aware of the existence of a facial
image on the Moon. This is the face of Jesus Christ, which is a formation
of light 200 miles long.’ American citizens also insisted that NASA give
some explanations regarding this picture. But, for the reason of His Divine
Eminence Gohar Shahi being Asian, NASA maintained silence.

In his book ‘Pictorial Astronomy’, Prof. Dinsmore Alter, a professor in
NASA and an expert in astronomy, made changes in the picture and
presented it in the form of a woman. It spread a rumour in the entire
Christian missionary that a picture of Lady Mary exists on the Moon.

When the news was published in Pakistani newspapers, many people
verified the existence of the picture on the Moon, after they investigated
the matter thoroughly. Some made a mockery of this matter without 
carrying out any investigation. Some regarded it to be an act of sorcery.
After some time, there was talk of the existence of the picture in space.
However, it did not manage to earn the attention of common folks, for
except the following of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi.

In 1998, the Parcham, a daily newspaper, published a news item that a
human face is visible in the Holy Black Stone. We were already aware of it.
We possessed some marked up pictures of the Holy Black Stone and almost
every follower of His Divine Eminence also had investigated the matter
thoroughly. We remained silent to avoid potential uproar and mischief. The
newspaper reports encouraged us, and we also issued a press release and
our statement regarding the matter. Almost all Muslims investigated the
matter, because the matter was closely linked with their faith. A majority
of them were convinced of its truthfulness. The image was so clear that it
was next to impossible to deny it. However, some people labelled it as an
act of magic.
The images of the Moon and the Holy Black Stone were publicised and
promulgated in almost all countries of the world. Saudi Arabia and its
supporters were utterly displeased, as though His Divine Eminence
Gohar Shahi himself had placed his image in the Holy Black Stone! They
exclaimed, ‘Images are prohibited in Islam, how could an image appear on
the Holy Black Stone?’ They failed to acknowledge that God’s signs cannot
be prohibited. Saudi Arabia acquired a decree from its Sharia (religious)
courts that His Divine Eminence was Wajib al Qatal (deserving of the
death penalty): if His Divine Eminence sets his foot on Saudi soil, He
should be assassinated. In Pakistan also, pro-Saudi sectarian elements are
trying their hardest to eradicate His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi and
His teachings. False charges and cases of blasphemy (Section PPC 295)
against His Divine Eminence have been instigated. Assassination attempts
have been made on His Divine Eminence several times.


### Now the picture of His Divine Eminence is visible on the Sun also 


We have contacted the Pakistani government regarding the cases, and
have invited them to examine and investigate the images; however, the
government has denied these Divine Signs under the influence of the
sectarian elements. Moreover, The Nawaz Sharif Government influenced
the provincial government of Sindh to also trap, suppress, and eradicate
His Divine Eminence. Presently, we ask the military regime to also carry
out a just investigation of these images (Divine Signs), and demand that
these images must not be denied under any fear, pressure or influence from
sectarian elements.

These Divine Signs are meant to eradicate mischief not the opposite.
And it is evidently obvious, because His Divine Eminence’s message and
teachings are based on God’s love and global peace, which have attracted
people of all religions to reform and purify themselves.

And today, all the Hindus, the Muslims, the Sikhs and the Christians are
becoming united because of their mutual love and respect for His Divine
Eminence Gohar Shahi. This is the first time in history that a Spiritual
Leader has been invited and respectfully seated on the pulpit of worship
places of all the major religions such as Churches, Gurdwaras and Hindu
Temples for lectures and sermons.

Such a person (His Divine Eminence), who is divinely anointed and is
the pride of the country should be encouraged. God manifests His signs
to elaborate the truthfulness of His Divine Eminence. And the alchemy
of His Divine Eminence’s eyes revives hearts of humankind with God’s
remembrance, and turns them into God’s lovers.

Theologians and groups that are enemies of the Saints and the household
of Prophet Mohammad are very entrenched against His Divine Eminence
Gohar Shahi. They are trying to divert the attention of the public from
Hajar al Aswad (Holy Black Stone) by their instigation of bogus cases,
baseless plots and negative propaganda against His Divine Eminence
Gohar Shahi. This is a very important and sensitive matter. The faith of the 
Muslims is in jeopardy. Why is the investigation in this matter not taken
up? There has been so much propaganda in the world, both negative and
positive, regarding the Holy Black Stone that it has become impossible to
suppress it.

Even the scholars, who believe in the Saints, observed silence due to their
grudge and jealousy towards Gohar Shahi. Since the image is so clear and
they cannot deny it, now they say that the Moon is under the effect of
magic. Remember well: Prophet Mohammad said, ‘Any act of magic is
ineffective on and to the Moon.’

They allege that even the Holy Black Stone is under the effect of magic.
Food for thought: If the Ka’aba also is under the effect of magic, then the
Muslims are left with hardly any place for sanctuary and protection of
faith! They say, ‘Even Prophet Mohammad once was affected by magic,
and the Ka’aba is not greater than Prophet Mohammad!’

Verily! Magic was cast on Prophet Mohammad, however, God sent the
verse of Wannas to nullify the effects of the magic. You also are advised
to recite the verse of Wannas to nullify the effects of magic, if any, on
the Moon, and the Holy Black Stone. In case, the verse Wannas further
brightens up the images instead of nullifying them, then you will have to
admit the truth, otherwise, you are possessed by Abu Jahal (the father of
ignorance).
