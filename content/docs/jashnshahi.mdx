## What is Jashan-e-Shahi and the Reasons Why it is Celebrated?

On the 15th of Ramadan 1977, a series of unique secretive conversations
(Ilhaamat or inspiration) with God also began. The promise of ‘Radhiya
Mardhiya’ (‘Your will is my will, my will is your will’) took place and rank
was also granted. Since every rank (martaba) and ascension (meraaj) is
related to the 15th of Ramadan, this is why in order to express feelings of
happiness and thanksgiving, Jashan-e-Shahi is celebrated every year.

In the year 1978, His Divine Eminence moved to Hyderabad, Sindh,
and began to shower the grace of divine guidance on mankind, and in
a short span of time, His spiritual grace spread throughout the world.
The hearts of millions of people were revived with God’s remembrance.
God’s name, ‘Allah’ was imprinted on the hearts of millions of people,
and they witnessed it on their hearts. Hundreds of thousands of people
acquired access to Kashf Al Qaboor (the ability to speak to the subtlety of
Nafs of the departed Saints) and Kashf Al Hudhoor (access to the court
of Mohammad). His Divine Eminence has cured millions of people with
terminal diseases. After having received the teachings and guidance from
His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi, the people from every religion, every
nationality, and every race acquired the love of God, and began to reach
the Essence of God.

**‘By God! I too am from those people, on whose hearts the name
“Allah” is so beautifully written and shining.’—Sheikh Nizam-Uddin,
Maryland, U.S.A.**
