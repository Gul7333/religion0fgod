## The Tenet of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi

If the pious ones and the worshippers of all religions stand in a row, and
God is requested to manifest His accord as to which ones of them would
He prefer to look at, who would He choose? As you would involuntarily
look at the glittering stars, whether it is Mars, Mercury or an unknown
star, in a similar fashion would God look at the enlightened hearts only,
whether or not they practise a religion.

**Sachal Sain said, ‘When one does not have God’s love, Islam hardly
differs from the Kufr.’**

You, in search of God, rush to worship places such as Temples, Churches,
and Mosques! Has anyone seen God sitting in any worship place in history?
O’ Fools! The dwelling of the Lord is in your heart. Domicile God in your
heart; then you shall see that these worship places and its worshippers will
run towards you. Bayazid stated, ‘I circumambulated Ka’aba (the Muslims’
sacred place of worship in Mecca) for some time. Since God inhabited me,
Ka’aba began circumambulating me.’ The worship places are collection
points for good virtues; whereas, the heart is the Divine Abode. In worship
places, you shall call upon God. In the hearts, God shall call upon you.

*Not in the fate of the intellectuals is found the Taste of Passion,*

*Those who sacrifice everything are the Bearers of Ishq (Rapturous Lovers).*

*And one cannot find God by repeating God’s name.*

*One must seek a Spiritual Guide, for only they can take one to God.*

Every religion strongly believes that their Prophet is the most eminent and
glorified. And this belief caused wars between them. Through spiritual
sciences, you should first gain access to the gatherings of the Prophets,
for only then you will learn which Prophet possesses what spiritual status
and rank.

## Important Note

God called every Prophet with a unique name which served as their
respective Kalima and means of recognition for the following of the
Prophets. These names were in His own language (Suryani). By declaring
the respective Kalima, one gets admitted into the following of the Prophet.
Declaring thrice is the condition. After his admittance into the following
of the Prophet, the more frequently one repeats these words, the more
purified he gets. The chanting of these words at the time of adversity
becomes a rescue. In the grave also, these words happen to soften the
accountability. Even for entry into the paradise, repetition of these words
is the condition.

Followings of all Prophets are advised to memorise these words, and recite
them at dawn and at dusk as much as they can. You may read the celestial
books in your own language for the purpose of guidance. However, for
worship, the original text of the original book renders more spiritual
benefits.
