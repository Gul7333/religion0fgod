## The word Allah

God communicates with the angels in Suryani which is spoken in the
celestial spheres. Adam spoke the same language while he was in paradise.
When Adam (Safi Allah) and Eve descended on Earth, they resided in the
Arab region. This language, as their progeny spread in the world, through
Arabic, Persian and Latin, reached English through literal evolution. People
called God with different names in different languages. Adam resided in
the Arab region; therefore so many Suryani words are still present in the
Arabic language. Adam was known as Adam Safi Allah (the word ‘Safi
Allah’ is from Suryani), Noah was called as Nouh Nabi Allah, Abraham
was called as Ibrahim Khalil Allah, then Moses as Musa Kalim Allah,
Jesus as Isa Rouh Allah, and Mohammad as Mohammad Rasul Allah. All
these phrases (mottos) were already written on the Preserved Scripturum
in the Suryani language prior to the arrival of these Prophets in the world.
This is why Mohammad said that he had already been a Prophet before
his arrival in this world.

**Some people perceive, the word ‘Allah’ is a Muslim name for God.
This is not true.**

Mohammad’s father’s name was Abd Allah, which predates Islam. The
word ‘Allah’, even before Islam, has been used in mottos of all Prophets.
After their creation, the first word the souls uttered was ‘Allah’. Adam’s
soul also uttered, ‘Ya Allah’ before it entered his body. Some religions
understand the truth behind this secret; therefore, they do not hesitate
to use the word ‘Allah’ for God’s remembrance. Some others deprive
themselves of the grace of the word ‘Allah’ due to doubts and reservations
to its truthfulness.

**Any name alluding to God is worthy of respect, and it directs one
towards God.**

However, these names differ in effectiveness. According to numerology
and syllable laws, every word has a separate numerical value. This also is
one of the many types of heavenly knowledge. These units encompass the
entire creation. Sometimes, these units are in disagreement with each other
according to the knowledge of astronomy. This leaves the man under worry
and stress. Many people, seeking zodiac charts from the experts of this
knowledge, name the newborn. Just as the Arabic alphabets, for example:
(ا,ب,ج,د
) (4,3,2,1), have a numeric value ten. Similarly, every name has a
separate numeric value. When God was called upon by different names,
these names became a cause of disharmony with each other according
to alphabetical knowledge. Had all humanity called upon God by one
name, all would have been united inwardly despite different religions.
Then, they would say, as did Nanak Sahib and Baba Farid, ‘All souls are
created with God’s Light; however, their environment and their vicinities
are separate.’

The angels are taught languages of the world before they are deployed in
the world. It is necessary for the members of all nations of the Prophets
that they repeat the declaration of their respective faith, as it was granted
by God for purification, identity and grace, in the original language
at the time of the particular Prophet. Affirmation of the declaration
of faith is a must for all to adopt a religion. Verbal vows, as in the
marriage, are mandatory for admission into paradise also. But in the
western countries, most Muslims and Christians are not aware of the
original wording of their declaration of faith, and the original name of
their Prophets.

Those who confine themselves to verbal affirmation of the declaration of
faith, they scarce spiritual deeds of the heart (Aamal-e-Saliha). And those
who do not affirm the declaration even verbally, they shall not enter the
paradise. And those only shall enter the paradise without accountability
whose hearts absorbed the declaration of faith. The celestial books in their
original form only, serve as a means to convene the aspirants to God. But
when the celestial books and their translations were tampered with, just as adulterated flour is harmful to the stomach, similarly these altered books
became harmful to the religions. Thus, the followers of one religion and
one Prophet were divided into many sects. For acquisition of the Sirat al
Mustaqeem (the Divinely Established Path), seek guidance through Noor
(God’s Light) also.

## The Method of Producing Divine Light

In the olden days, fire used to be produced from the method of rubbing
stones together. The rubbing of iron objects together also produces a spark.
The splashing of water also produces electricity. Similarly, in human beings
the circulating blood, meaning the throbbing of the heart, also produces
electricity. A human body possesses 1-1½ volts of electricity, which sustains
agility in him. The electricity and agility is lessened in the old age due
to the falling speed of throbs. Initially the heartbeats have to be made
prominent. Aspirants have utilised various methods, such as dancing,
sports activity, exercise-work out, and through loud chanting with strike
of God’s name also.

As the heartbeats get prominent, try to synchronise ‘Allah Allah’ with
every beat or ‘Allah’ with one heartbeat and ‘Hu’ with the other. Place your
hand on the heart sometimes, feel your heartbeats and try to synchronise
the name ‘Allah’. Occasionally, synchronise ‘Allah’ with the pace of the
pulse. Imagine the word ‘Allah’ is entering your heart. Dhikr (chanting)
of ‘Allah-Hu’ is better and more effective than that of Dhikr-Allah. Those
reluctant and afraid of ‘Hu’, instead of deprivation, they might as well
synchronise just ‘Allah’ in their heartbeats. People of Dhakuriyah (science
of God’s remembrance), and Wird-o-Wadhaif (verbal chanting with the
rosary) ought to stay as clean as possible.

> ‘Those who show respect, they obtain the benevolence. And those who
don’t show respect, they remain deprived.’

### The First Method
On a piece of paper, write the word, ‘Allah’ with a black pen or pencil for
as long as you feel comfortable. Do this exercise every day. One day, the
word ‘Allah’ will begin to float before your eyes. Then, try to bring it in
your heart from the eyes through visualising it.
### The Second Method
Write the word ‘Allah’ in a yellow colour on a white bulb (zero watt, a type
of bulb that we normally use at night time in bedrooms). Try to absorb it
in your eyes by looking at it, any time during the day or just before you
sleep. Once it is absorbed within your eyes, visualise it to bring it in your
heart.
### The Third Method
This method is suitable for those that carry out this practice under the
guidance of a Spiritual Guide, and acquire spiritual help from their guide
due to their spiritual relation and connection. Sit in isolation. Use your
index finger to visualise and to write the word ‘Allah’ on your heart. You
may as well seek help from your Spiritual Guide in this matter, and visualise
he is holding your finger and writing the word ‘Allah’ on your heart.

Practice this daily until the word ‘Allah’ is seen written on your heart.
Through the earlier mentioned methods, ‘Allah’ is inscribed as seen written
outside on the paper. When the word ‘Allah’ begins to synchronise with
the heartbeats, it gradually begins to glitter. Since in this method help of
the Spiritual Guide is available, the word ‘Allah’ is seen beautifully written
and shining on the heart from the beginning.

Many Prophets and Saints came in this world. During loud chanting, as
a test, you may visualise all Prophets and Saints, one by one. Whoever
your destiny is attached with will appear before you. Your heartbeats will
rise in chanting, and you will see spiritual growth also. Then, select him
for visualisation because every Saint is related to a certain Prophet in the
spiritual system, though a living Prophet is not a condition. The destiny
of every devout lies with a certain Saint. For spiritual benevolence, the 
Spiritual Guide must be physically alive. Occasionally, some lucky aspirant
is granted Malakutee Faiz from the Kamil Dhat (Divinely Accomplished
Guide) who is living, but not physically; however, it is rare. Verily! The
tombs of the departed Saints may render mundane benevolence. This is
known as Owaisi Faiz. Owaisi Faiz is a form of spiritual training where
the guide renders spiritual grace in dreams and by esoteric means, whether
or not the guide is living. Aspirants in Owaisi Faiz are often troubled and
confused by what they see in dreams, and Kashf (spiritual unveiling). This
is because their guide is in Batin (Esoteric Realm), and the Satan is also in
Batin, and it becomes so difficult to recognise who is who.

The concerned knowledge is as important as the Faiz (spiritual grace)
itself. And a living Spiritual Guide is more suitable. Faiz without the
required knowledge will turn the aspirant into a Majzoob (an enlightened
person who lost the intellect in God’s love). Faiz accompanied by Ilm (the
required knowledge) turns the aspirant into a Mehboob (Beloved of God).
Mehboob renders Dunyawee Faiz (mundane benevolence) and Ruhaani
Faiz (spiritual grace and training) to people through his Ilm. Whereas the
Majzoob renders Dunyawee Faiz to people by beating them with sticks
and swearing at them.

> **If none in your visualisation appears
to help you, you might as well turn to His
Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi for help!**

Religious affiliation is not mandatory; however, one must not be
predestinedly ill-fated. A large number of people may obtain the grace
of God’s name (initiation of the heart) from the image of His Divine
Eminence Gohar Shahi on the Moon also. The method of obtaining the
spiritual grace from the Moon: when the full moon is in the east, look at it
carefully, say ‘Allah’ thrice as you see Gohar Shahi’s picture on the Moon.
And now, you are blessed! Now, start the exercise without any worries or fear
according to the method mentioned here. Verily! The image of His Divine
Eminence Gohar Shahi on the Moon has spoken with many individuals in
all languages. You also may speak with the image on the Moon.
