## Human life exists on Mars. Creatures made of fire live on the Sun.
**Mars: People of all religions live on Mars. Our scientists have not
reached Mars yet. However, the Martians have been to Earth many
times. They have taken with them a few men from here for experiments.
They are far more advanced in scientific knowledge and inventions
than we are. Even if our satellites and scientists reach Mars, they
cannot escape the Martians’ hold.**

God granted an abundance of knowledge to one of the Adams. His
progeny gained access to Bait al Mamour (House of the Appointed One)
through that knowledge. They would hear, on Earth, the commandments
of God given to the angels. One day, the angels said, ‘O’ God, this nation
is causing interference in our affairs. When we arrive in the world to
accomplish our tasks, they have already found a deterrent.’ God directed
Gabriel to test them. A twelve-year-old boy was grazing goats and Gabriel
asked him, ‘Do you also possess some knowledge?’ The boy said, ‘Ask me.’
Gabriel said, ‘Tell me, where is Gabriel now?’ The boy closed his eyes, and
said, ‘He is not in the skies.’ Gabriel asked, ‘Where is he?’ The boy said,
‘He is not on any land either.’ Gabriel asked, ‘Then where is he?’ The boy
opened his eyes and said, ‘I have searched for him in the fourteen levels
of the seven realms, but he is not anywhere. Either I am Gabriel, or you
are.’ Then God commanded the angels to drown this nation by flooding.
They heard this decree of God, hence, began to build homes with iron
and glass. They were destroyed through an earthquake. The ancient name
of that region was Qalda, and now it is known as Greece. They, through
spiritual knowledge interfered with divine affairs, and now our scientists,
through the knowledge of science, are causing interference with the affairs
of God.

In order to intimidate them, God plans destruction on a small scale,
whereas, a comet has been sent towards Earth for total destruction. The
comet is expected to fall on Earth in the next 20-25 years. That will be
the last day of this world. A fragment of the comet has already fallen on
Jupiter, two years ago. The scientists are aware of this and they plan to
settle on the Moon or any other planet before the comet falls. Booking of
the plots has already taken place on the Moon. They know that the basic
elements of life such as air, water and plantation are absent on the Moon;
then what is this endeavour aimed at? If they are making all these efforts
for scientific research, what is the benefit to humanity even if they have
reached the Moon and Jupiter? Have they discovered a breakthrough
medicine which can prolong the ageing process, or a medicine that can
defeat death? Even if our people reached Mars, they, due to the difference
of oxygen on Earth and Mars, would not survive there. Money is being
wasted on futile endeavours. Had the United States of America and Russia
utilised the wealth on the poor, it would prosper all of humanity. Just
because they belong to different Adams, they are making atomic bombs
to destroy each other; whereas the world is destined to come to an end by
itself without needing bombs.
