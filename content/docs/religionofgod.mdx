## The Religion of God

All religions were established by the Prophets in this world; however,
prior to this, God himself was Love, the Lover, and the Beloved. And for
the souls that were in nearness, the divine manifestation and love of God
was the Religion of God. Then, these souls, when they were sent to this
world, sacrificed all their possessions in order to reach God. The Religion
of God was primarily confined to the elite only, and now it has been made
accessible to the common folks also, through the widespread of spiritual
knowledge.

A Prophetic Tradition narrated by Abu Hurera: ‘I received two different
types of knowledge from the Prophet Mohammad. I told you of one, you
would kill me if I told you the other.’

When Mevlana Rumi’s Spiritual Guide pulled up the dry books from the
pond, Mevlana Rumi exclaimed, ‘What is it?’ Shah Shams, the guide, said,
‘You are not aware of this knowledge.’

Moses asked God ‘Is there any other type of knowledge, apart from what
you have bestowed upon me?’ God directed Moses towards Khidr.

Every worshipper’s prayer: ‘O’ God, guide me unto the Straight Path, the
one of those that you are pleased with.’

The famous poet of the east, Iqbal, said, ‘And what does a naive clergyman
know of it (the Religion of God)?’

The souls which were granted ranks in the primordial time loved God,
and God loved them. Such souls remained loyal to God in the world also.

Jesus Christ miraculously spoke in infancy, and announced that He was a
Messenger. The Archangel Gabriel had already given glad tidings of Jesus’
birth to Mother Mary. Pharaoh had been foretold of a child’s birth in a
certain tribe who would cause destruction to him, and that the child would
be one of the elite servants of God. Prophet Mohammad also said, ‘I was
already a Prophet prior to my arrival in this world.’ Many of the loving and
predestined souls are present in various religions and bodies.

## Observations:
### Deen-e-Ilahi (God’s Religion)

God has sent to the world 124,000 Prophets and five Grand Messengers
for the guidance of humankind, and they have established 313 different
religions to facilitate humankind to earn paradise and reach their ultimate
destiny.

Deen literally means lifestyle. Deen-e-Ilahi is God’s lifestyle. God’s lifestyle
is the Religion of God, and it is as ancient as God Himself. God is all
love, and He manifests His attributes on daily basis. To be able to adopt
God’s lifestyle is to adopt God’s religion. Many religious scholars may
not comprehend its unique nature and subtle application; however, God’s
religion is above all religions.
