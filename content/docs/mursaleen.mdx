## Declarations of the Mursaleen (the Grand Prophets)

### The Christian Motto:
‘La Ilaha Ill Allah Isa Rouh-Allah.’ None other is Deity (Ilah) for except
Allah (God)-Jesus is Spirit of God.

### The Jewish Motto:
‘La Ilaha Ill Allah Musa Kalim-Allah.’ None other is Deity for except
Allah—Moses talks to Allah.

### The Abrahamic Motto:
‘La Ilaha Ill Allah Ibrahim Khalil-Allah.’ None other is Deity for except
Allah-Abraham is Friend of Allah.

### The Muslim Motto:
‘La Ilaha Ill Allah Mohammad Rasul-Allah.’ None other is Deity for
except Allah-Mohammad is the Messenger of Allah.

The Hindu and Sikh religions are linked with the religions of Adam and
Noah. Since Adam revered the Holy Black Stone, they adopted the ritual
of worshipping idols. Those who survived from the great hurricane of
Noah propagated in India. Indian Gurus obtained spiritual knowledge and
spiritual grace from Khidr also. The names such as of Adam (Shankar Jee)
and Khidr (Vishnu Maharaj) are found in the wordings of their prayers.

Followers of all religions, regardless of the different languages they speak,
should recite these Kalimas in Suryani, for they are the source of their
recognition and salvation. Common folks need to remember God and
their respective Messenger at least 33 times a day, in the morning and
the evening. One ought to remember God 99 times to be protected from
worldly problems on a daily basis, in the morning and in the evening or as
much as one may be able to do. One should remember God 5,000 times
to prevent calamity in advance. More than one person may collectively
remember God ranging from 25,000 to 72,000 times, and the maximum
figure is 125,000 times in one sitting.

In order to purify the heart and to efface the black spots of sins (according
to a Prophetic Tradition, ‘An angel is appointed to every human being
to place black spots on their hearts as a result of committing sins’), do a
breathing exercise. Inhale ‘La Ilaha Ill Allah’, and exhale the second part
of the Kalima; concentrate on the heart while exhaling. In acquiring love
and the proximity of God, there is yet another method, which is difficult
without God’s Will. According to the method mentioned here, one has to
turn the heartbeats into a constant rosary, and synchronise just the word
‘Allah’ alone in the beating system. Do this exercise daily as much as you
can. Dhikr (invocation) can start in some people without them having to
concentrate on it, while others have to concentrate, and some others (after
the revival of Qalb and Rouh (soul)), can feel it at all times.

God’s Friends invoke God’s name 72,000 times a day, whereas God’s lovers
reach the figure of 125,000 times a day. And when other subtleties also
engage in God’s remembrance, even the Karaman Katibeen (the appointed
angels who keep the record of good deeds) fail to count the frequency.

*‘Some of the seekers remain on land, and some others reach the domain of
God.’*

*‘Some others have spiritual access to the Ka’aba, and some others are in God’s
audience.’*

Those who practise a religion had better visualise their respective Prophet’s
name as well as ‘Allah’, to balance the heat of the word ‘Allah’. They should recite the Kalima of their Prophet until the state of Jalal (majestic
effects), Jazb (ecstasy) and Wajd (spiritual pleasure) ends. Also visualise
the Spiritual Guide you have met in person, to utilise his spiritual power
to write word ‘Allah’ on your heart. Those who do not practise a religion
may or may not have a predestined Spiritual Guide. They ought to visualise
the names of all five Grand Messengers categorically, and also the Saint
they believe in and have met. Then, whomever they belong to will begin to
speak in them. In short, they will begin to love, be inclined and directed
towards him.

Once upon a time in history, people of the celestial books were united. They
were allowed to share food among each other and inter-religion marriages
were allowed as well. Similarly, in the present era, people of Dhikr (Heart
Invocation) will be united. People of the celestial books were united and
gathered temporarily as the book was confined to their tongue (it did not
enter their hearts) only; it vanished away. People of the Heart Invocation
shall be permanent, as the Name of God and its Divine Light would enter
their bloodstream and heart. It is difficult for the illness that has entered
the blood, or love that has entered the blood, to come out from it.

Water does not form into electricity until it is splashed together. Milk
is churned to produce butter. Similarly repetition of the original verses
of Celestial Books creates Divine Light. Repetition of verses and the
Names of Divine Attributes produces Sifati Noor (Divine Light of the
Attributes). Its access is up to the Malaika (the archangels). This is Bil-
Wasta (indirect, requires medium). This is the stage of Wahdat Al Wajoud
(unity in existence). Noor (Divine Light) produced by repetition of the
personal name of God ‘Allah’ has direct access to God and this is Bila-
Wasta (direct, requires no medium). This relates to Wahdat Al Shahood
(unity in witnessing).

Some people love, respect and honour their Prophet and Saints, however,
they bear animosity for the Prophets and Saints of other religions. Such
people are very unlikely to earn any spiritual status from God, because
they talk ill of those whom God loves. It is God Himself who appointed
them into different religions.
