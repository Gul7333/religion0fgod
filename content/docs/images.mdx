### Moon

In the 1991 Summer-Fall
edition of the Phoenix
Official Visitor’s Guide,

Eminence Gohar Shahi on
the Moon is clearly visible.

A close-up of the image of
the Moon from the Phoenix
Official Visitor’s Guide cover.
It has been blurred so the
face of His Divine Eminence
is further prominent.
According to this letter from
the photographer, 

‘The
enlargement of the moon,
which I photographed over
downtown Phoenix in
February 1990, does have
the likeness of a man in
profile when viewed rotated
90 degrees.’

“More details about the Moon are on the next page.”

God said, ‘We will show you our signs in the near future, in the universe
and within yourselves until you believe this is the truth.’

‘Look for his signs in the skies, in the land, and in space; the signs belong
to the one who will appear from the east.’—Allama Iqbal

The image of the moon has been rotated in an anti-clockwise direction.
By doing this, the images on the Moon become clearly visible.

The comparisons between various pictures of His Divine Eminence
Gohar Shahi and images of the Moon show that the face on the Moon
is indeed of His Divine Eminence.

The images were taken from the book Pictorial Astronomy

When it was revealed in the United States that the image on the Moon is
of a person of Asian origin and whose features suggest that He is a Muslim;
subsequently, the image was rotated clockwise. The photograph above (1)
is an original photograph of the Moon. The photograph (2) relates to the
Moon also. This has been modified: A part of the face and beard have
been altered to show hair of the head while deleting the face which is
clean shaven. Photograph (3) above depicts the attempt Dinsmore made
to portray it as a woman’s so that viewers would be misled into believing
that it is the image of the Virgin Mary. The chin has been shortened in the
photograph, the neck profile made smooth and the eyes elongated.

**A distortion of the signs of God is not a good omen as these images
will soon become apparent throughout the whole world.**

**Images of the Moon published in various articles, and printed by
many companies.**

Whether you are in the east or the west, try taking a photograph of
the Moon with your personal camera, from any angle, and you will see
these images.

Nevertheless, the evidence of your truthfulness is in you dwelling in
my heart.’—Younus AlGohar**

Shahi is seen very clearly.

### Space

![phoeniximage](../../Public/21.png)

This article discusses the findings of NASA in relation to a face in space
estimated by NASA scientists to be the size of 150 suns. The article talks
about how strange it is that the face in space had never been discovered
before, given its size.
According to Astronomer Isaac Hawkins of Atlanta, GA, ‘This is plainly
the image of a man’s face far, far off in the universe.’ The article explains
how this miraculous image was clearly distinguishable one moment
and then astonished observers by somehow retreating from view the
next moment. The article speculates that the image is something on a
‘[technologically] advanced level.’ This discovery was also the first due
to which NASA consulted with theologians, as ‘The idea that this could
be the face of God [had] crossed [their] minds.’

> This image of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi is in fact a spiritual
entity known as Tifl-e-Noori. Only special Saints have been known to
possess this. References are found in various books by Sufis.

### Black Stone

***A human face is discovered on the black stone (Hajar Al Aswad) in
Mecca, Saudi Arabia.***
![phoeniximage](../../Public/23.png)


> According to this article, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdallah stated in relation
to the appearance of a human face in the Holy Black Stone, ‘Spiritualists
in Mecca say that this is the face of the awaited Imam Mehdi.’

*Source: A Human Face Discovered on the Holy Black Stone in Mecca, Saudi Arabia;
Staff Reporter, the Daily Parcham (Karachi, Pakistan), May 26, 1998.*

According to this report, ‘It is said amongst spiritual circles that in
addition to his facial image becoming prominent on the Sun and Moon,
the face on the Holy Black Stone is that of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
of Pakistan.’
![phoeniximage](../../Public/24.png)


Above: a clipping of the monthly Great God Magazine’s article about
the image on the Holy Black Stone. The article speculates whether the
face is of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi, and shows a comparison
between an image of His Divine Eminence and an image of the Holy
Black Stone, which has been digitally contrasted to highlight the face
within it.
![phoeniximage](../../Public/25.png)

The image is so clear that no one can deny its existence. Many are saying
that the image is the face of the awaited Imam Mehdi AS. An excerpt
from this newspaper article:

> ‘According to a facsimile received from Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Hammad bin
Abdallah has issued a press release from Mecca. It states that prior to the
pilgrimage, clear signs of a human image were visible on the Holy Black
Stone. The image is inverted; for this reason is not visible at first sight. But
it can be clearly seen once it has been pointed out. Sheikh Hammad bin
Abdllah has said that there could be two reasons for this image; either it
has appeared naturally or perhaps it is manmade. As the Black Stone is
heavily guarded by officials and given that there are masses of pilgrims
around it at all times, it is unlikely that any person would be courageous
enough to make and place an image on the Black Stone. The question
arises: if the image has always been on the Black Stone, then why has no
one noticed it? The image is so clear it cannot be denied or rejected.’

This is the unaltered cover of a textbook on religion published by the
Government of Punjab. It is inverted here to show the human image
that is clearly visible within the Holy Black Stone.

These images taken from Mirza Library and the Pakistani textbook are
upright. When upright, another image is seen in the Holy Black Stone.
It has been isolated on the far left.

The image is marked and highlighted for easy recognition here. It is also
of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi.

At the age of 25, Jussa-e-Gohar Shahi (the sub-spirit of Gohar Shahi)
was coronated as the Commander of the Esoteric Cavalry.

### Nebula

**This photograph has recently appeared on a planetary nebula a Sun-
like star, it was released by NASA**
![phoeniximage](../../Public/31.png)


The image of the Eskimo Nebula taken by NASA has been rotated in
an anti-clockwise direction to reveal a face with something written on
it. It is indicated, and compared to an image of His Divine Eminence
Gohar Shahi.
![phoeniximage](../../Public/32.png)

The original photograph of NGC 2392 has been rotated to expose more
images of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi.

Many people say, ‘These images are simply imagination.’ Imagination
is confined to one who imagines; imagination cannot be captured on
camera. Others declare it to be telepathy or mesmerism—however,
places of worship, the land and the sky cannot be subject to telepathy
or magic; if this is the case then where is the truth? Some others say that
the United States has received money to digitally place the images in
these celestial bodies. Is Gohar Shahi wealthier than the USA? If it were
possible to place these images, then the United States would have used
the image of the Pope as to benefit its religion and country.

turned upside down, the image of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi
is visible.

### Science and Technology

‘In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of Mars. On the surface
of Mars, there was a rock found which resembled the face of a human
being. It was one mile long and 2000 feet high. It was made by beings
that were similar to us and had lived there in the past. An astronomer, Dr
Frania, says, “This is the proof of the one we have been awaiting for a long
time.”‘—A translated excerpt in regards to the Face on Mars from Science
and Technology, The Jang Sunday Magazine, (Pakistan), published on
March 18, 2001.

### People ask, ‘Why do you publicise these images?’

We reply, ‘These images are signs from God. They have purpose and indicate
to the seekers of the truth that they may approach God through this man
who is God’s existing representative.’ It is the signal for both the sinners
and those who do not believe in any religion, that they too should adopt
the way of guidance and find salvation through the Divine Knowledge
that God has bestowed upon him. God has made this knowledge simple
and easy in accordance with your nature.

People often inquire whether it is the truth. If it is not then we are
blatant liars. (Curse upon liars).
