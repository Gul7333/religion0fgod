## Man, Since Creation to Infinite

As God intended to create souls, he said, ‘Be’ and countless souls came into
existence. By and beside God were the souls of the Prophets. In the second
row were the souls of the Saints, and then in the third row were the souls of
the faithful ones. They were followed by the souls of common folks. And
then, at a distant row that fell beyond God’s sight, were created the souls
of women who were followed by the animal, botanical and mineral souls
respectively. Mineral souls were unable to move.

On God’s right were the angels, followed by the heavenly damsels who
were unable to see God’s face. For this reason the angels cannot see God.
Behind them, were the souls of Muakkel (angel-like creatures), which later
came into the world as auxiliary assistants to Prophets and Saints. To God’s
left were the souls of the Jinns, followed by infernal spirits and evil spirits
who aided the Satan in his work after coming into the world.

Souls on God’s right and left, and those beyond God’s sight could not
witness the Divine Manifestation. This is the reason why Jinns, angels and
women may speak with God, but they cannot see God.

There was a spheroid of fire in the terrestrial globe. It was commanded
to cool down, thereafter, its fragments scattered in the space. The Moon,
Mars, Jupiter, Earth and the stars are all fragmented parts, whereas the
Sun is the remnant of the spheroid of fire. Initially, Earth was nothing
but ashes in the whole. Mineral souls were sent down to consolidate the
ashes into stone. Then, botanical spirits were sent down to sprout trees and
plantation in the rocks. Thereafter, animals appeared from animal spirits
coming to Earth.

God further asked all souls if He was their creator. All souls affirmed in
positive, and prostrated; even the souls of stones and trees prostrated to
God. ‘The stars and the trees prostrated to God.’ (Chapter Rehman, the
Koran).

Then, God created a modelled world and its luxuries in order to test
and examine the souls. And God said, ‘Should anyone seek it, they may
obtain it.’ Too many souls turned their back on God and leapt towards the
modelled luxuries of the world. Therefore, they were declared hell-bound
in the book of their fate. Then, God depicted the scene of the paradise,
which was better than the latter and concerned itself with the servitude
and obedience. Many souls leapt towards it, and the paradise was written
in their fate. Too many souls were indecisive, hence, they were placed in
between the Lord and the Devil. They were entangled between the two
when they came in this world. Whoever influenced them first, they became
theirs. Many souls fixed their eyes on the Divine Splendour. They desired
none of the world or paradise. God loved them, and they loved God. Such
souls for the sake of God, shunned the world, became recluse, and lived
in jungles.

To serve the needs of the souls and for their pleasure, eighteen thousand
types of creatures were brought in existence: six thousand in the sea, six
thousand on the land and six thousand in the air and celestial realms.

> **_Then God created seven types of paradise
and seven types of hell._**

**The seven heavens are:**

Khuld, Daar-us-Salaam, Daar-ul-Qaraar, Eden, al-Mawa, Naeem and
Firdaus.

**The seven hells are:**

> Saqar, Saeer, Nutaa, Hutama, Jaheem, Jahanum and Hawia.

All the above mentioned names are from Suryani, the language that God
speaks with the angels.

It is a common tenet in all religions that God may send to hell or heaven
whosoever He wishes to. If a soul had been sent to hell from the scene in the
primordial time, it would object, ‘What crime did I commit?’ God would
say, ‘You turned away from me and desired the world.’ The soul would say,
‘That was merely a decision out of poor intelligence, nevertheless, I did not
act upon it.’ To settle this argument the souls were sent down on Earth.

Adam’s (Shanker Jee) body was created with clay from paradise. In addition
to the human soul, some other spirits also were placed in the body. Adam’s
body was still in the process of creation when the Iblis spat at it out of sheer
jealousy. The saliva fell on the belly button. The saliva along with its germ
entered the body. The Satan is from the nation of the Jinns. According to a
Prophetic Tradition, a Satanic Jinn is born with every man. Similitude of a
body is that of a mud-house. And there are sixteen spirits enclosed within
it, in addition to Khannas (the Whisperer) and four other birds.

Substance, in the form of a woman emerged from the left rib of Adam.
A soul was placed in it which came to be known as Eve. Following the
forced exit from the paradise, Adam was dropped in Sri Lanka, and Eve
was in Jeddah. Thus, the Asian lineage began through them. Hence,
the remaining souls also started to descend on Earth from the heavens
periodically. Institutions in form of religions were established for the
training, schooling, and levels of the souls. The souls were then divided into
assorted religions, and some others were kept without a religion according
to their predestined fate.

God-loving souls also came in this world, and took birth in Muslim, Sikh,
Hindu and Christian homes; they sought God according to the principles of
their religions. For this reason, the elite in all religions adopted hermitage.
Some people wrongly project that Islam does not allow hermitage. Prophet
Mohammad also went to the cave of Hira. Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani,
Khawaja Moeen-ud-Din Ajmeri, Data Ali Hajweri, Bari Imam, Baba
Farid, Shahbaz Qalander etc, acquired high mystical ranks only after
they had adopted hermitage. And the Saints alone are responsible for the
widespread of the religion.
