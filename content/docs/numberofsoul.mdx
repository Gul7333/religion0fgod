## The Number of Souls Created in the Heaven Exceeded the Limit

The souls of the Elite (Muqarrib) were in the foremost row. Ordinary souls
were sent into the nations of Adams that were created in this world. These
Adams were created with black, white, yellow and red clay. Gabriel, Harut
and Marut taught them knowledge.

As the Adams were created with clay in this world, the infernal Jinns would
manage to enter them and their progeny’s bodies and would attempt to
gain control over them. Then the Prophets and the Saints in those nations,
and the knowledge they taught, were the means for their salvation. A
majority of Adams were created in the form of pairs that initiated a chain
of progeny. However, occasionally only a woman was created as Adam
and the progeny was initiated with the help of the Command, ‘Be’. These
nations still live in this world. In such tribes, only women are the leaders.
Just because they are progeny of a woman, they perceive God also is
a woman. They consider themselves to be the progeny of the angels.
Since their female Adam’s progeny was born without marriage and male
copulation, this custom is still part of their culture. The women of these
tribes bear children by anyone and later marry some other man. They do
not regard this custom as indecent.

In accordance with the nature of the souls, the choice they made in the
primordial times, their destiny and their spiritual status, a similar natured
Adam was sent to guide such souls. Therefore, no proper religion was
formulated for them. Any Prophets sent into them were accepted but by a
few people only. Rather, most of them acted the opposite to the teachings
of the Prophets. Instead of God, they worshipped the Moon, the stars, the
Sun, trees, fire and even the snakes.

Eventually, Adam Safi Allah was created in paradise with the clay thereof,
so as to elevate him in eminence and superiority above all. And so that
he may be protected against the infernal creatures, because paradise was
inaccessible to the infernal creatures. Azazeel read the situation due to
his intelligence. He was appointed the leader of the angels owing to his
excessive worship. He was from the nation of the Jinns. Out of jealousy,
he spat on Adam’s body, and by means of the saliva, a germ similar to an
infernal creature penetrated the body of Adam, which is known as Nafs.
The progeny of Adam thus, inherit the Nafs. That is what this Prophetic
Tradition, ‘A Satanic Jinn is born with every human being,’ alludes to.

The angels are different from the archangels. The angels dwell in Malakut,
and the angels and the souls were created simultaneously. Above Malakut
is Jabrut and the creatures thereof are known as archangels, which existed
well before the souls were created with the Command, ‘Be’.

God commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam Safi Allah. No
other Adam was created in the paradise previously; neither had the angels
prostrated before any other Adam. Azazeel was reluctant and denied
to prostrate before Adam Safi Allah, hence, he was cursed. This is why
he initiated enmity against Adam Safi Allah’s progeny. Nations of the
previous Adams were safe from the enmity of Azazeel and the infernal
Jinns sufficed to incite them. Since the Satan was more powerful than all
the infernal Jinns, he controlled and taught the progeny of Adam Safi Allah
such disgusting crimes that the other nations reproached the Asians. And
eminence of Adam Safi Allah was the reason why those among his progeny
whom God guided became sublime and eminent, that the other nations
were stunned by their grandeur and envied them. The greatest celestial
books, the Old Testament, the Psalms of David, the New Testament and
the Koran were revealed upon the Messengers from among the progeny of
Adam Safi Allah. Through their teachings, benevolence and blessings, the
Asian religion spread among all nations of the world.

The soul was not yet inserted in the body of Adam Safi Allah, and the
angels realised that he too was being created to be sent into the world.
They knew for sure that the man made with clay dwells on Earth only.
And then God sent Adam into the world on some divine pretext. God
himself plots the eternal acts and the humans are held blameworthy for them. Had Adam Safi Allah been sent without being tricked into blame,
he would have always complained and grumbled in the world. He would
not repent or cry in modesty, would he?

1. If the predestined hell-bound souls are born in a non-religious
household, they turn into Kafir (rejector of truth) and Kadhib
(those who label the truth as a lie). These individuals are the atheists,
the enemies of the Prophets and the Saints. They are arrogant and
stone hearted men, and they find pleasure in harming the creatures
of God. The second category of the souls remain naive of the
religions even if they adopt a religion. They turn into hypocrites,
in the case that they are born in a religious household.
2. Such individuals are blasphemous to the Prophets, jealous of the
Saints, and cause mischief in the religions. Their worship also is
wasted like that of Iblis. The religion draws them towards the
paradise, but their fate pulls them towards the hellfire. Since they
remain deprived of the support and assistance of the Prophets
and the Saints, therefore, they are easily incited by their Nafs and
trapped in evil plots, afflicted by the Satan. They perceive that they
possess sufficient knowledge and perform excessive worship; hence,
they see no difference between the Prophets and themselves. Then
they begin to consider themselves as a Prophet without peeping
into their inner self. And they perceive that even the Saints stand
in need of them. They do not admit knowledge of spirituality,
and miracles, nevertheless, they only accept the acts which they
are able to perform. They reject even the miracles of the Prophets,
and label them as magic. They admit the powers of Iblis (the
Devil), but they are reluctant to admit the divine might, which
God invests in the Prophets and the Saints.
3. When a predestined heaven-bound soul takes birth in a non-
religious household or in an impure environment, it is known
as Mazour (Helpless). Mazour may qualify for the bakhshish
(concession) and divine pardon. These are the souls that seek the
favour of the Saints in their pursuit of Sirat al Mustaqeem and
to exit from the quicksand of sins. They are kind, humble and
generous.
4. If the predestined heaven-bound soul takes birth in a religious
household that practises a celestial religion, is known as Sadiq (natural believer) and Momin (enlightened believer). These are
the ones that through extensive Ibadah (worship) and Riyadhah
(extensive worship and struggle) obtain God’s nearness and become
worthy of the divine inheritance.

**Prophetic Tradition: ‘Faqr (spiritual poverty) is my pride, and it is
from me.’**
> The heart has the central and very
important role in spirituality.

The disciples raised the heartbeats in many ways such as striking beats on
the respective subtlety, dancing, Kabaddi (a type of sport), building walls,
demolishing them and through physical exercises. Then it became easier
to synchronise the word ‘Allah’ within the heartbeats and gradually the
word ‘Allah’, itself, reached all the subtleties of the breast. Some people,
without profound knowledge and awareness, started to imitate them, but
they failed. They adopted the method of repeating the word ‘Allah’ while
dancing. Neither did they know of synchronisation of the heartbeats with
God’s name nor did they manage to achieve it. Nevertheless, their bio-
spirit, which represents physical activity, became familiar with God’s name.
Repetition of the word ‘Allah’ with music strengthens the botanical spirit
and it also becomes familiar with the word ‘Allah’. Music is the sustenance
for the botanical spirit. In the USA, an experiment was conducted on some
crops through music. Similar crops were sowed in similar soil. Music was
played constantly, 24/7 on one crop, and the other was kept without music.
The one with the music was better in growth than the other.

The Nafs is a rigid tormentor. Even after the purification, the Nafs is fond
of making pretexts. It likes sound and music. Some individuals tried to
change its direction towards God through music. Some people repeated
the word ‘Allah’ while playing the guitar, and reached the worship by
ears, though they could not obtain anything further. A guitarist relayed
to me a story that he, as a hobby in his leisure time, used to invoke upon
Allah while playing the guitar. Occasionally, as he woke up, he heard the
invocation of Allah from within himself in the same manner. These people
are better than singers, musicians and listeners; nevertheless, they could not
reach any rank of Sainthood. Such people are enthusiastic, zealous and in
search for God. Through a Perfect Spiritual Guide, they may reach their
spiritual destiny. Sufis in Islam and other religions also adopted the way of
absorbing God’s name through various means and methods. Anything that
directs one towards God, and increases in His love is not disallowed.

> Tradition of the Prophet: ‘God looks at the intentions, not the actions.’

People of Sharia (religious law) label it as blameworthy and wrong because
they are content and satisfied with Sharia. But those who want to go
beyond Sharia and want to obtain God’s love, or those who don’t practise
Sharia, should not be halted from seeking a substitute.
