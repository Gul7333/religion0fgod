## His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi’s Revolutionary Message to Humankind

**A Muslim says, ‘I am superior to all.’ A Jew declares, ‘I am even better
than the Muslim.’ And a Christian says, ‘I am greater than both the
Muslim and the Jews, and the rest of the religions, because I am the
nation of God’s Son.’**

But His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi declares that superior and best of
all is the one who possess God’s love in his heart, in spite of his indifference
to any religion.

‘Performance of verbal rituals depicts his obedience and submission to God,
whereas invocation by the heart serves as an intermediary to obtaining
God’s love and communication with God.’

Those whom God has granted some rank are divinely verified and those
that copy are heretic. The false claimant of Prophet-hood is Kafir (rejector
of truth) whereas a false claimant of Sainthood is not far behind Kufr
(rejection of truth). A Saint is God’s Friend, and it is essential for a friend
to have spoken with him and seen him. Prophet Mohammad once warned
his companions that some of the deeds of the Prophet must not be copied
and that they are confined to the Prophet only.

The prayers of every Musalli (worshipper): ‘O’ God, show me the way of
those upon whom you bestowed your bounty.’ The true Salat has to be
performed in Bait al Mamour, and the soul continues to perform such Salat
even after the physical demise, just as the souls of all the Prophets offered Salat in Bait al Muqaddas (Dome of Rock) on the Night of Ascension
(Laila tul Meraaj). The seeker must abide by the law of Sharia until he has
seen God unveiled. Nevertheless, God has ordained a substitute for the
sinners and those who are lazy in worship. Heart Invocation with God’s
name indemnifies for the sins and missed out worships, and it turns the
aspirant into an enlightened conscience and lover of God eventually.

__‘Then do remember your Lord whilst standing, sitting and tossing on
your bed, as when your prayer (Salat) missed out.’ (Koran)__

Nearness, attachment, amiable glances and well-wishes of the Saints also
brighten the fate of sinners, and save them from hell. Please note that
Prophet Mohammad sent his companions to Owais Qarni to pray for
salvation of his Ummah (following). Generosity, Riyadhah (extensive
worship and struggle) and martyrdom also may indemnify for the sins,
and qualify the sinner for salvation. God appreciates modesty, repentance
and tears also. ‘God’s favour: due to this, Nasuha, the one who used to
steal the shrouds of dead bodies, and who used to dishonour and assault
dead bodies of women, was forgiven by God.’ (The Koran)

One day, Jesus asked the Satan, ‘Who is your best friend?’ The Satan
replied, ‘A miser worshipper.’ Jesus exclaimed, ‘Explain how?’ The Satan
said, ‘His stinginess nullifies his worship.’ Jesus continued to ask, ‘Who is
your worst enemy?’ The Satan said, ‘A generous sinner.’ Jesus exclaimed,
‘Explain how?’ The Satan said, ‘His generosity washes away his sins.’

Those who love and take care of God’s Elite and the common creation, and
those who support Haq (the Truth) maintain justice also become worthy
of God’s Mercy.

One day the poet, Iqbal, when he was a student of 3rd or 4th grade, was
returning home from his school when he saw a female dog following him.
He climbed the stairs to his home, while the female dog kept staring at
him senselessly. He thought, ‘Perhaps she is hungry.’ His father had left a
loaf of bread for him. He put before her a half of the loaf. She ate it right
away, yet she kept staring at him senselessly. He fed her the other half
too, and remained hungry for the rest of the day. His father received glad 
tidings during the night regarding the appreciable act of his son that he
had become God’s Favourite.

Subaktgeen noticed that a deer was following behind his horse as he started
to ride away from the jungle, carrying a baby deer. Subaktgeen stopped and
noticed that the deer stopped too, raising her head and staring into the sky.
Subaktgeen realised that tears were rolling down her eyes. He released the
baby deer. Following this incident, God showered so much mercy upon
him that afterwards he would often weep in the name of God.

**Mevlana Rumi says, ‘A moment’s company of a Saint is far better than
the sincere worship of one hundred years.’**

**A Holy Tradition of Prophet Mohammad states, ‘God says, “I become
his tongue with which he speaks, and I become his hands with which
he holds.”’**

Abu Dharr Ghaffari said, ‘On the Day of Judgement, as the people
recognise the Saints, they will say, “O’ God, I helped him with ablution.”
God will reply, “Let him be granted salvation.” Another man will say,
“O’ God, I gave him clothes to wear and gave him food to eat.” God will
reply, “Let him also be granted salvation.” This is how countless men will
find salvation.’

**Hadith Qudsee: God said, ‘And I declare war against those who bear
animosity towards my Saints.’**

God’s style of waging a war is not beheading somebody for once, rather He
destroys the faith of the criminals, and such criminals continue to suffer
from this agony eternally ever after in hell.

People say, ‘Worship is the means to find God.’ I declare, ‘The heart is the
passage that leads to God.’

Worship is but the means to cleanse the heart. You are remotely far off
God should you fail to cleanse the heart through worship. God warns, ‘It
is not the actions, the bodies and the faces that I look at, rather, the hearts
and intentions therein.’ Nevertheless, performance of worship may lead one to paradise. God however, is still far off reach. This esoteric knowledge is
suitable to those who aim not to go after paradise and its damsels but to
seek just love, proximity and union with God.

Then as it appears in the verse of Kahaf, ‘God helps them find a Spiritual
Guide (Wali-Murshid).’

When God is pleased by an admirable act of His servant, God looks at
him out of utter love, and that washes away his sins. Those who keep
company of such individuals also come under the Merciful Sight of God.
God’s Friends, ‘The Companions of the Cave’ were in deep meditation.
Meanwhile, God continued to look at them with love and affection, which
will lead to their companion dog’s entry into paradise. When Sheikh Farid
earned God’s Merciful Sight, the shepherd accompanying him was also
blessed.

When God became pleased with Abu Al Hassan due to his efforts, God
began to speak with him. One day, God said to him, ‘O’ Abu Al Hassan,
people will stone you to death if I tell them about you.’ He replied, ‘Nobody
will prostrate before you if I tell them how merciful you are!’ God said,
‘Don’t tell them anything, and either will I.’

When Zayed was arrested for the third time for consuming alcohol, the
Companions of the Prophet said, ‘Curse him, he repeats this crime time
after time.’ Prophet Mohammad said, ‘Do not curse him, for he loves God
and His Messenger, and those who love God and His Messenger cannot be
sent to hellfire.’ Verily, God loves and takes care of all His creation. God
provides for even the helpless insects that dwell in stones. As disobedient
offspring are punished and disinherited, similarly, God becomes a penaliser
for the disobedient and blasphemous ones.

Believe the fact God wants to look at you also, but you are either naive,
careless or ill-fated. You beautify and groom your face with soap and
cream because people look at it. Have you ever cleansed what God wants
to look at?

**A Prophetic Tradition states, ‘There is a cleanser for washing up all
objects, as for the heart; God’s remembrance.’**

Those who just verbally proclaim and say, ‘I love you,’ are merely bluffing.
Love is an involuntary gift that manifests unplanned. You begin to love
what dwells in thy heart! Platonic love concerns itself to the heart. The
means of bringing God in the heart are visualisation of God’s name, God’s
remembrance articulated within the heartbeats, and the Saints.

The engine alone cannot make a vehicle work and it cannot transport
anybody to their destination until other parts of the vehicle are also
fitted in it. Similarly, Salat is also incomplete without attainment of the
mortification of the Self (Nafs) and purification of the heart. When you
think that without these necessities your worship is sufficient, and that
this will earn you the paradise, then why do you label others as hell-bound
when they too worship? The difference is one is riding on the donkey of
Jesus Christ, and the other on the donkey of the Anti-Christ. However,
both are black and darkened in the hearts. (Meaning, one has faith in Jesus
but is deprived of the purification of the heart, hence he is fooling himself
into believing that he belongs to Jesus. The other one has a troubled heart,
hence his heart is darkened). They follow different creeds only, and the
creeds will not go forth but the souls will.

When Salat is confined to verbalisation only, and the heart is polluted with
absurdities such as greed and jealousy, it is known as Salat al Surat (worship
of the body only). Common folks suffer from this wishful thinking, and
continue to be victims of sectarianism. Their propagation of religion creates
mischief within the religion. For example: you practised a sectarian school
of thought, and worshipped for 10-15 years, and later you realised some
other sectarian school of thought was correct, and you joined it. It suggests
that the previous sect you practised was false. And God doesn’t honour any
worship practised under a false belief system. This is how you rejected the
worship (Salat) you carried out for 10-15 years. The chances are the new
sect you have adopted might as well be a false one. And all your previous
and future worship became a total waste. And at the end of the day you
found yourself back to square one where you started from. You should have
sought a Spiritual Guide than to waste your precious time.
