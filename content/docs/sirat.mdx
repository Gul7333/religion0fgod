## Sirat al Mustaqeem

Those whose outward is correct but inward is darkened, are a cause of
mischief within the religion, and are caliphs of Iblis (the Devil). Tradition
of the Prophet Mohammad: ‘Be fearful of the ignorant scholar and distance
yourselves from him whose tongue is a scholar but the heart is ignorant
(meaning darkened).’

Those whose inward is pure but outward is impure are known as Majzoob
(spiritually incompetent), Mazour (Helpless), Sukar (spiritually intoxicated)
and Munfarid (Unique).

**Taryaq-e-Qalb: ‘What of the accountability when the intellect is lost
in God’s love!’**

They (Majzoob) are a sign of perplexity in the religion however they are
in nearness to God. They cannot obtain any further rank or spiritual
status. The appointed ones on the ranks are divinely verified, whereas the
imposters become heretics. And it was the appointed ones who beat up and
verbally abused persons like former President Ayoub, Benazir Bhutto and
Nawaz Sharif when they were in power. Could you beat up somebody in
power? Thus, certain acts are confined to the appointed ones only, and a
common man cannot copy them.

If the outward and the inward both are enlightened and pure, and one
engages himself in the outward form of worship as well as invocation
by heart, such individuals are known as Alim-e-Rabbani (the Divine
Scholars). They inherit the intuitional understanding of the religion
and are the Prophet’s representatives. As when an individual’s external 
and internal both are unified, they are known as Second-to-God. If he
performs Hajj spiritually or in a dream, then he is rewarded for this
pilgrimage performed in Batin as much as he would have been rewarded
for the physical pilgrimage or even greater than that. Ritual prayer by souls
is entitled to be equivalent to the outward prayer. Verily, even greater than
that! When such an individual performs ritual prayers (Salat) outwardly, it
is highly ranked in spirituality also. These are the individuals whose bodies
are here among people on earth yet their souls are with God there in higher
realms. In the faculty of faqr (the spiritual poverty), such individuals are
called Mua’arif (whose soul is the Saint) also. Seeing God suffices and
satisfies the thirst of God’s lover. Some people say, ‘God cannot be seen.’
Beware: Prophet Mohammad introduced the knowledge through which
God can be seen. Imam Abu Hanifa said, ‘I saw God in dreams ninety-
nine (99) times.’ Bayazid Bastami said, ‘I saw God seventy (70) times.’
God can be seen through the Faculty of Ana (which lies in the head).
However, you are indifferent and unaware of its concerned knowledge
and invocation.

## The Friend of God:

If people believe someone to be a Saint based on his spiritual insight,
marvels and spiritual benevolence, but their heart is disgusted by his
religion or any of his deeds, they better stop visiting him rather than
passing bad remarks about him. Beware! Someone may be an apple of
God’s eye or a Sheikh Baqa, a Laal Shahbaz, a Khidr or a Sai Baba! You
may also encounter an Eternal Divine Bride.
