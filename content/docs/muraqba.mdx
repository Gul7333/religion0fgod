## Chapter of Muraqibah

Most people try to establish meditation without awakening and spiritually
strengthening their souls. Either the Satan traps them or they fail to
establish the meditation at all. Meditation is suitable for the advanced-
level seekers only, who have purified their hearts and mortified their Self
(Nafs). Trying to establish Muraqibah is an act of folly for the beginners
of the path, regardless of the nature of worship used therewith. Gathering
the strength of the souls with God’s Light, and arriving at their concerned
station is Muraqibah.

> Sainthood is one-fortieth part of Prophet-hood

All dreams, all Muraqibah, all Ilhaam, and Wahee (Revelation through
Gabriel) of a Prophet are correct. Therefore, it does not need verification.
However, only forty out of a hundred dreams, Muraqibah and Ilhaam
(Revelation direct from God) of the Saints are correct, and the rest are
wrong. Hence, it needs esoteric knowledge for its verification.

> Identification of God is not possible without the required knowledge.

The lowest level of Muraqibah is established only after the awakening of
the subtlety of Qalb. It is not possible without the opening of the heart.
One shock brings the person back into consciousness. Istikharah (seeking
divine help) also relates to the subtlety of the heart (Qalb). The next stage of
Muraqibah is with the subtlety of the human soul. It takes three shocks to
return to consciousness. The third Muraqibah is established together with
the subtleties of the human soul and Ana. The human soul travels up to
the Realm of Jabrut along with the subtlety of Ana, just as Gabriel travelled
along with Mohammad up to the Realm of Jabrut. Whilst in Muraqibah,
such people are so deeply lost in that state that they remain unaware of
their surroundings even if they are buried in graves. ‘Companions of the
Cave’ were in similar Muraqibah, because of which they remained in a
sleeping state for over a period of 300 years. Whenever Abdul Qadir Jilani,
a Saint from Baghdad, would occupy with such a Muraqibah in the jungle,
the thieves from the jungle would bury him in a grave considering him
dead. The Muraqibah would always break just before the burial.

> Recognition of Extraordinary Inspiration and Revelation from God

As an aspirant, following the awakening and enlightenment of the
subtleties of the breast, becomes worthy of receiving divine theophanies,
God converses with him. God is Absolute Power, and He can converse
with human beings by any means or methods, however, he has introduced
a unique method in order to safeguard His Friends from falling prey to
evil deception.

Firstly, the text appears on the heart in Suryani language, along with its
translation in the language of the seeker. The text is white and bright, and
the eyes close involuntarily, and watch the text (internally). The text then
passes through Qalb, and moves on to the subtlety of Sirri as a result of
which, it gets even brighter. Akhfah adds more brightness to it before it
finally arrives to the tongue and the tongue spontaneously begins to read
out the text. If this is an evil distortion, an enlightened heart dims the text,
and if the text is powerful, then the subtleties of Sirri or Akhfah efface this
text. If supposedly due to the weakness in the subtleties of the breast, the
text reaches the tongue, the tongue then stops it from utterance.

This type of inspiration is exceptional to the elite of the Saints. God
conveys messages to common Saints through angels and souls. The Wahee
(Revelation) is exclusively classified to the Prophets only, and its text is
always accompanied by Gabriel.
