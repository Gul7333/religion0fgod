## In the End Timess

In the end, God will send forth one of the above mentioned souls. He will
find and unite them together. And He will remind them that they also
once loved God. All such souls whether or not they are religious will attend
to his call, and flock around Him. He will grant them a unique name of
God, which will pass through their hearts and settle in their souls. The
souls will constantly engage with the repetition of that name (the soul will
become a permanent Dhakir). The unique name of God will confer on
them a brand new enthusiasm, a new power and a new definition of love.
The Noor (Divine Energy) of the unique name of God will reconnect the
soul with God.

Dhikr Qalb serves like an intermediary ladder to obtaining Dhikr Rouh
(invocation of the soul), just as the rituals of Salat (a form of worship) and
fasting are means of obtaining the invocation of the heart. If the soul of
an individual has learnt to invoke God, he is among those who shall have
no fear of accountability and the Divine Scale on the Day of Judgement.
The advanced stages of invocation and worship of soul confirm his elevated
rank. Individuals that are progressing in spirituality from the heart towards
the soul are among those who have entered the Religion of God or are
about to enter it. Their means of guidance is God’s Light, not the books.
God’s Light, itself, keeps them away from committing sins. And those
who, even by striving or by learning about it, are deprived of this spiritual
status, are not included in this Spiritual League. Heretics are those that,
without invocation of the heart and the soul, consider themselves among
those in this Spiritual League or imitate them. The means of salvation
for common folks is worship and religion. The means of guidance are the
celestial books. The means of intercession are through the Prophets and the
Saints. Many Muslims do not accept the fact that the Saints can provide
people with intercession to God. However, Prophet Mohammad advised
his companions to request Owais Qarni to provide his Ummah (following)
with intercession to God.
